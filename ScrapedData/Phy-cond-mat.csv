Entanglement of single-photons and chiral phonons in atomically thin  WSe$_2$","Xiaotong Chen, Xin Lu, Sudipta Dubey, Qiang Yao, Sheng Liu, Xingzhi Wang, Qihua Xiong, Lifa Zhang, Ajit Srivastava"," Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon which, on the one hand,
reveals deep connections between quantum mechanics, gravity and the space-time;
on the other hand, has practical applications as a key resource in quantum
information processing. While it is routinely achieved in photon-atom
ensembles, entanglement involving the solid-state or macroscopic objects
remains challenging albeit promising for both fundamental physics and
technological applications. Here, we report entanglement between collective,
chiral vibrations in two-dimensional (2D) WSe$_2$ host --- chiral phonons (CPs)
--- and single-photons emitted from quantum dots (QDs) present in it. CPs which
carry angular momentum were recently observed in WSe$_2$ and are a
distinguishing feature of the underlying honeycomb lattice. The entanglement
results from a ""which-way"" scattering process, involving an optical excitation
in a QD and doubly-degenerate CPs, which takes place via two indistinguishable
paths. Our unveiling of entanglement involving a macroscopic, collective
excitation together with strong interaction between CPs and QDs in 2D materials
opens up ways for phonon-driven entanglement of QDs and engineering chiral or
non-reciprocal interactions at the single-photon level.

Spin-orbit effects surfacing on manganites","S. Valencia, M.J. Calderón, L. López-Mir, Z. Kostantinovic, E. Schierle, E. Weschke, L. Brey, B. Martínez, Ll. Balcells"," Spin-orbit coupling in magnetic systems lacking inversion symmetry can give
rise to non trivial spin textures. Magnetic thin films and heterostructures are
potential candidates for the formation of skyrmions and other non-collinear
spin configurations as inversion symmetry is inherently lost at their surfaces
and interfaces. However, manganites, in spite of their extraordinarily rich
magnetic phase diagram, have not yet been considered of interest within this
context as their spin-orbit coupling is assumed to be negligible. We
demonstrate here, by means of angular dependent X-ray linear dichroism
experiments and theoretical calculations, the existence of a noncollinear
antiferromagnetic ordering at the surface of ferromagnetic
La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ thin films whose properties can only be explained
by an unexpectedly large enhancement of the spin-orbit interaction. Our results
reveal that spin-orbit coupling, usually assumed to be very small on
manganites, can be significantly enhanced at surfaces and interfaces adding a
new twist to the possible magnetic orders that can arise in electronically
reconstructed systems.

Finite-temperature charge dynamics and the melting of the Mott insulator","Xing-Jie Han, Chuang Chen, Jing Chen, Hai-Dong Xie, Rui-Zhen Huang, Hai-Jun Liao, Bruce Normand, Zi Yang Meng, Tao Xiang"," The Mott insulator is the quintessential strongly correlated electronic
state. A full understanding of the coupled charge and spin dynamics of the
Mott-insulating state is thought to be the key to a range of phenomena in
ultracold atoms and condensed matter, including high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity.
Here we extend the slave-fermion (holon-doublon) description of the
two-dimensional Mott insulator to finite temperatures. We benchmark its
predictions against state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations, finding
quantitative agreement. Qualitatively, the short-ranged spin fluctuations at
any finite temperatures are sufficient to induce holon-doublon bound states,
and renormalize the charge sector to form the Hubbard bands. The Mott gap is
understood as the charge (holon-doublon) gap renormalized downwards by these
spin fluctuations. With increasing temperature, the Mott gap closes while the
charge gap remains finite, causing a pseudogap regime to appear naturally
during the process of melting the Mott insulator.

Magnetoelectric effect in cylindrical topological insulators",A. Martín-Ruiz," Topological insulators (TIs) exhibit a quantized magnetoelectric response
when time-reversal symmetry is broken on its surface. This unusual
electromagnetic (EM) response is a unique macroscopic manifestation of the
quantum Hall effect on the TI surface and it is described by a quantized
Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we construct the Green's function (GF)
describing the EM response of two topological media separated by a cylindrical
interface. This GF, in the appropriate limits, describes the magnetoelectric
effect of both i) a cylindrical TI surrounded by a dielectric fluid, and ii) a
TI with a cylindrical dielectric-filled cavity. We calculate the EM fields
produced by a line charge and a line current near the TI surface and we show
that, in addition to the standard image electromagnetic sources, charge and
current densities of magnetic monopoles will also appear. We discuss some
experimental setups which could be used to test these magnetic monopole fields.

Viscoelastic shear stress relaxation in two-dimensional glass forming  liquids","Elijah Flenner, Grzegorz Szamel"," Translational dynamics of two-dimensional glass forming fluids is strongly
influenced by soft, long-wavelength fluctuations first recognized by D. Mermin
and H. Wagner. As a result of these fluctuations, characteristic features of
glassy dynamics, such as plateaus in the mean squared displacement and the
self-intermediate scattering function, are absent in two dimensions. In
contrast, Mermin-Wagner fluctuations do not influence orientational relaxation
and well developed plateaus are observed in orientational correlation
functions. It has been suggested that by monitoring translational motion of
particles relative to that of their neighbors, one can recover characteristic
features of glassy dynamics and thus disentangle the Mermin-Wagner fluctuations
from the two-dimensional glass transition. Here we use molecular dynamics
simulations to study viscoelastic relaxation in two and three dimensions. We
find different behavior of the dynamic modulus below the onset of slow dynamics
(determined by the orientational or cage-relative correlation functions) in two
and three dimensions. The dynamic modulus for two-dimensional supercooled
fluids is more stretched than for three-dimensional supercooled fluids and it
does not exhibit a plateau, which implies the absence of glassy viscoelastic
relaxation. At lower temperatures, the two-dimensional dynamic modulus starts
exhibiting an intermediate time plateau and decays similarly to the
three-dimensional dynamic modulus. The differences in the glassy behavior of
two- and three-dimensional glass forming fluids parallel differences in the
ordering scenarios in two and three dimensions.

Electronic structure of graphene-nanoribbons on hexagonal boron nitride","Yohanes S. Gani, D.S.L. Abergel, Enrico Rossi"," Hexagonal boron nitride is an ideal dielectric to form two-dimensional
heterostructures due to the fact that it can be exfoliated to be just few atoms
thick and its a very low density of defects. By placing graphene nanoribbons on
high quality hexagonal boron nitride it is possible to create ideal quasi one
dimensional (1D) systems with very high mobility. The availability of high
quality one-dimensional electronic systems is of great interest also given that
when in proximity to a superconductor they can be effectively engineered to
realize Majorana bound states. In this work we study how a boron nitride
substrate affects the electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons. We
consider both armchair and zigzag nanoribbons. Our results show that for some
stacking configurations the boron nitride can significantly affect the
electronic structure of the ribbons. In particular, for zigzag nanoribbons, due
to the lock between spin and sublattice degree of freedom at the edges, the
hexagonal boron nitride can induce a very strong spin-splitting of the spin
polarized, edge sates. We find that such spin-splitting can be as high as
40~meV.

Pressure-induced multiple phase transformations of the BaBi$_3$  superconductor","Li Xiang, Raquel A. Ribeiro, Udhara S. Kaluarachchi, Elena Gati, Manh Cuong Nguyen, Cai-Zhuang Wang, Kai-Ming Ho, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield"," Measurements of temperature-dependent resistance and magnetization under
hydrostatic pressures up to 2.13 GPa are reported for single-crystalline,
superconducting BaBi$_3$. A temperature - pressure phase diagram is determined
and the results suggest three different superconducting phases ${\alpha}$,
$\beta$, and $\gamma$ in the studied pressure range. We further show that
occurrence of the three superconducting phases is intuitively linked to phase
transitions at higher temperature which are likely first order in nature.
$T_p$, which separates phase ${\alpha}$ from $\beta$ and $\gamma$, is
associated with an abrupt resistance change as pressure is increased from 0.27
GPa to 0.33 GPa. Above 0.33 GPa, an ""S-shape"" anomaly in the
temperature-dependent resistance curve, $T_\text S$, is observed and associated
with the transition between the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ phases. Further increasing
of pressure above 1.05 GPa suppresses this transition and BaBi$_3$ stays in
$\gamma$ phase over the whole investigated temperature range. These
high-temperature anomalies are likely related to structural degrees of freedom.
With the ${\alpha}$ phase being the ambient-pressure tetragonal structure
($P4/mmm$), our first-principle calculations suggest the $\beta$ phase to be
cubic structure ($Pm-3m$) and the $\gamma$ phase to be a distorted tetragonal
structure where the Bi atoms are moved out of the face-centered position.
Finally, an analysis of the evolution of the superconducting upper critical
field with pressure further confirms these transitions in the superconducting
state and suggests a possible change of band structure or a Lifshitz transition
near 1.54 GPa in $\gamma$ phase. Given the large atomic numbers of both Ba and
Bi, our results establish BaBi$_3$ as a good candidate for the study of the
interplay of structure with superconductivity in the presence of strong
spin-orbit coupling.

Emergent flat band lattices in spatially periodic magnetic fields","M. Tahir, Hua Chen"," Motivated by the recent discovery of Mott insulating phase and unconventional

more generic ways of getting two-dimensional (2D) emergent flat band lattices

number of new interesting opportunities, for example determining the Burgers
vector of an unknown dislocation in a fast and straightforward way.

spin-orbit coupling, treating the superconducting order fully
self-consistently. We find pronounced hybridization between the end point
Majorana bound states (MBSs) and in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, which
causes increasing MBS energy oscillations as a function of magnetic impurity
strength, even when the direct MBS overlap is negligible. By treating the MBSs
as topological boundary modes dependent only on the effective mass gap, we
arrive at a fully parameter-free fitting of the MBS localization length. The
localization length decreases with magnetic impurity strength, contradictory to
the behavior of the effective superconducting coherence length.

in ultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells, a remarkable decrease is
observed in the resistance on the metallic side of the transition, where the
resistance drops by more than an order of magnitude with decreasing temperature
below $\sim1$ K. It is also found that as the residual disorder in an electron
system is drastically reduced, the critical electron density of the transition
has a tendency to become smaller than the density of a possible divergence of
the effective mass at the Fermi level, determined by electron interactions.
This indicates that these two densities are not directly related and that the
critical density for the MIT is affected also by the residual disorder.

Spin-motive force due to domain wall motion in the presence of  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction",Yuta Yamane," We theoretically demonstrate that the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
Interaction (DMI) can lead to enhancement of the spin-motive force (SMF)
arising due to field-induced ferromagnetic domain wall motion. A SMF refers to
an electric voltage induced by dynamical magnetic textures, which reflects the
temporal and spatial variations of the magnetization. A DMI can introduce extra
spatial rotation of the magnetization in the domain wall region, which turns
out to cause the enhancement of the SMF. We derive an expression for the SMF,
and examine the field- and DMI-dependences of the SMF. We find that the SMF can
be amplified by up to an order of magnitude in the low field regime, where the
external field is lower than the so-called Walker breakdown field.

Renormalizations in unconventional superconducting states born of normal  and singular Fermi-liquids","Kazumasa Miyake, Chandra M. Varma"," The density of low energy particle-hole excitations is non-analytic in a
singular Fermi-liquid, but it is altered on entering a superconducting state in
which, in the pure limit, it vanishes asymptotically at the chemical potential
and in general is analytic. The single-particle excitations in the
superconducting states are then quasi-particles so that a form of Landau theory
may be constructed for thermodynamic and transport properties in the
superconducting state. In this theory, the renormalization of measurable
properties due to quasi-particle interactions, such as specific heat,
compressibility, magnetic susceptibility, superfluid density, etc. changes in a
temperature dependent fashion from the non-interacting theory. This is
illustrated by showing the renormalization of these quantities and the relation
between the parameters introduced to account for their temperature dependence.
When the renormalizations in the normal state are large or singular,
temperature dependence of properties in the superconducting states are then in
general not useful for identifying the nodal character or symmetry of the
superconducting state except for measurements at very low temperatures, upper
limits of which are specified. The results obtained are expected to be useful
in interpreting the experimental results for the temperature dependence of
various properties in the superconducting state born of singular Fermi liquids.

Precise control on morphology of ultrafine LiMn2O4 nanorods as  supercapacitor electrode via two-step hydrothermal method","Niraj Kumar, K. Guru Prasad, T. Maiyalagan, Arijit Sen"," We report three different synthesis routes while maintaining similar reaction

ultrafine one dimensional LiMn2O4 in the form of nanorods. We developed a novel
method of mixing the precursors through hydrothermal, yielding low dimensional
precursors for effective solid state reaction to synthesize the nanorods.
However, to achieve these, highly uniform beta-MnO2 nanorods were initially
grown as one of the main precursors. The uniformity observed in as grown
beta-MnO2 nanorods using hydrothermal technique help to attract minute LiOH

Fluctuation spectroscopy of surface melting of ice without, and with  impurities","Takahisa Mitsui, Kenichiro Aoki"," Water, in its three phases, is ubiquitous, and the surface properties of ice
is important to clarifying the process of melting, as well as to various other

theoretically and experimentally, for over a hundred years, while being an

properties are experimentally indistinguishable from those of liquid water.
Measured thicknesses are found to be much smaller than the previous
experimental measurements close to the bulk melting temperature. We find that
the additions of impurities at ppm levels cause LLL to be thicker, as well to
be quite inhomogeneous, with properties depending on the dopant. This is
revealed by scanning the surface at $\mu$m level resolution, and can contribute
to the slipperiness of ice in natural settings.

Dynamical spin-spin susceptibility of Silicene","Surajit Sarkar, Suhas Gangadharaiah"," We present a detailed study of the imaginary and real parts of the
spin-susceptibility of silicene which can be generalized to other buckled
honeycomb structure. We find that while the off-diagonal components are
non-zero in individual valleys, they add up to zero upon including
contributions from both the valleys. We investigate the interplay of the
spin-orbit interaction and an external electric field applied perpendicular to
the substrate and find that although the xx and yy components of the
susceptibility are identical, they differ from the zz-component. The external
electric field plays an important role in modifying the allowed inter-subband
regions. In the dynamic limit, the real part of the susceptibility exhibits
log-divergence, position of which can be tuned by the electric field and
therefore has implications for spin-collective excitations. The effect of the
electric field on the static part of the susceptibility and its consequence for
the long distance decay of the spin-susceptibility have been explored.

Charge redistribution and the Magnetoelastic transition across the  first-order magnetic transition in (Mn,Fe)2(P,Si,B)","M. Maschek, X. You, M. F. J. Boeije, D. Chernyshov, N. H. van Dijk, E. Bruck"," We used temperature dependent high-resolution x-ray powder diffraction and

was gradually tuned from a strong first-order (w = 0) towards a second-order
magnetic transition by substituting P by B. Increasing the B content leads to a
systematic increase in the magnetic transition temperature and a decrease in
thermal hysteresis, which completely vanishes for w = 0.08. Furthermore, the
largest changes in lattice parameter across the magnetic transition occur for w
= 0, which systematically becomes smaller approaching the samples with w =
0.08. Electron density plots show a strong directional preference of the
electronic distribution on the Fe site, which indicates the forming of bonds
between Fe atoms and Fe and P/Si in the paramagnetic phase. On the other hand,
the Mn-site shows no preferred directions resembling the behaviour of a free
electron gas. Due to the low B concentrations (w = 0 - 0.08), distortions of
the lattice are limited. However, even small amounts of B strongly disturb the
overall topology of the electron density across the unit cell. Samples

Shallow shell theory of the buckling energy barrier: from the Pogorelov  state to softening and imperfection sensitivity close to the buckling  pressure","Lorenz Baumgarten, Jan Kierfeld"," We study the axisymmetric response of a spherical shell under homogeneous
compressive pressure $p$ to an additional point force. For a pressure $p$ below
the classical critical buckling pressure $p_c$, indentation by a point force
does not lead to spontaneous buckling but an energy barrier has to be overcome.
The states at the maximum of the energy barrier represent a subcritical branch
of unstable stationary points, which are the transition states to a
snap-through buckled state. Starting from nonlinear shallow shell theory we
obtain a closed analytical expression for the energy barrier height, which
facilitates its effective numerical evaluation as a function of pressure by
continuation techniques. We find a clear crossover between two regimes: for
$p/p_c\ll 1$ the post-buckling barrier state is a mirror-inverted Pogorelov
dimple, for $(1-p/p_c)\ll 1$ the barrier state is a shallow dimple with
indentations smaller than shell thickness and exhibits extended oscillations,
which are well-described by linear response. We find systematic expansions of
the nonlinear shallow shell equations about the Pogorelov mirror-inverted
dimple for $p/p_c\ll 1$ and the linear response state for $(1-p/p_c)\ll 1$,
which enable us to derive asymptotic analytical results for the energy barrier
landscape in both regimes. Upon approaching the buckling bifurcation at $p_c$
from below we find a softening of an ideal spherical shell. The stiffness for
the linear response to point forces vanishes $\propto (1-p/p_c)^{1/2}$; the
buckling energy barrier vanishes $\propto (1-p/p_c)^{3/2}$; the shell
indentation in the barrier state vanishes $\propto (1-p/p_c)^{1/2}$. In the
Pogorelov limit the energy barrier maximum diverges $\propto (p/p_c)^{-3}$ and
the corresponding indentation diverges $\propto (p/p_c)^{-2}$. Numerical
prefactors for proportionalities are calculated analytically in both regimes.

Linear Absorption Spectrum of a Quantum Two-Dimensional Rotator  Calculated Using a Rotationally Invariant System-Bath Hamiltonian","Yuki Iwamoto, Yoshitaka Tanimura"," We consider a two-dimensional rigid rotator system coupled to a
two-dimensional heat bath. The Caldeira-Leggett (Brownian) model for the
rotator and the spin-Boson model have been used to describe such systems, but
they do not possess rotational symmetry, they cannot describe the discretized
rotational bands in absorption and emission spectra that have been found
experimentally. Here, to address this problem, we introduce a rotationally
invariant system-bath (RISB) model that is described by two sets of
harmonic-oscillator baths independently coupled to the rigid rotator as sine
and cosine functions of the rotator angle. Due to a difference in the energy
discretization of the total Hamiltonian, the dynamics described by the RISB
model differ significantly from those described by the rotational
Caldeira-Legget (RCL) model, while both models reduce to the Langevin equation
for a rotator in the classical limit. To demonstrate this point, we compute the
rotational absorption spectrum defined by the linear response function of a
rotator dipole. For this purpose, we derive a quantum master equation for the
RISB model in the high-temperature Markovian case. We find that the spectral
profiles of the calculated signals exhibit a transition from quantized
rotational bands to a single peak after spectrum collapse. This is a
significant finding, because previous approaches cannot describe such phenomena

Duality for open fermion systems: energy-dependent weak coupling and  quantum master equations","J. Schulenborg, J. Splettstoesser, M. R. Wegewijs"," Open fermion systems with energy-independent bilinear coupling to a fermionic

a unique dual physical system in which all energies are inverted, in particular
the internal interaction. This paper generalizes this fermionic duality in two
ways: we allow for weak coupling with arbitrary energy dependence and describe
both occupations and coherences coupled by a quantum master equation for the

Edge and bulk localization of Floquet topological superconductors","Tilen Cadez, Rubem Mondaini, Pedro D. Sacramento"," We study the bulk and edge properties of a driven Kitaev chain, where the
driving is performed as instantaneous quenches of the on-site energies. We
identify three periodic driving regimes: low period, which is equivalent to a
static model, with renormalized parameters obtained from the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion; intermediate period, where the BCH
expansion breaks down; and high period when the quasienergy gap at $\omega/2$
closes. We investigate the dynamical localization properties for the case of
quasiperiodic potential driving as a function of its amplitude and the pairing
strength, obtaining regimes with extended, critical and localized bulk states,
if the driving is performed at high frequencies. In these, we characterize
wave-packet propagation, obtaining ballistic, subdiffusive and absence of
spreading, respectively. In the intermediate period regime, we find an
additional region in the phase diagram with a mobility edge between critical
and localized states. Further, we investigate the stability of these phases
under time-aperiodicity on the drivings, observing that the system eventually
thermalizes: It results in featureless random states which can be described by
the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. In a system with open edges, we find that both
Majorana and fermionic localized edge modes can be engineered with a spatially
quasiperiodic potential. Besides, we demonstrate the possibility of creating
multiple Majorana $0$ and $\pi$ modes in a driven setting, even if the
underlying static Hamiltonian is in its trivial phase. Lastly, we study the
robustness of the Majorana modes against the aperiodicity in the driving
period, showing that the ones created via quasiperiodic potential are more

Scaling properties of centering forces","Serge Dmitrieff, Nicolas Minc"," Motivated by the centering of biological objects in large cells, we study the

non-autonomous centering (in which distance to the surface is integrated over
the whole surface). We find relations between the net centering force and the
mean distance$^p$ to the surface. This allows us to find simple scaling laws
between the centering force and the distance to the center, as a function of
the dimensionality $n$. Interestingly, if the interactions between the agent

sub-elastic in the case of autonomous centering. These scaling laws are
increasingly violated as the space becomes less convex. Generically, neither

formulated in terms of the twisted angles of the boundary condition, instead of
the single particle momentum, and involves an integration over all possible
twisted angles. However, this formulation is physically unnatural, since
topological invariants directly related to observables should be defined for
each Hamiltonian under a fixed boundary condition. In this work, we show via
numerical calculations that the integration is indeed unnecessary - the
integrand itself is effectively quantized and the error decays exponentially
with the system size. This implies that the numerical cost in computing the

suffices to compute the Berry connection for a single value of the twisted
boundary condition if the system size is sufficiently large.

Cyclic-loading microstructure-property relations from a mesoscale  perspective: An example of single crystal Nickel-based superalloys","Ronghai Wu, Michael Zaiser"," Past models of stress-strain response under cyclic loading mainly rely on
macroscopic equations which consider microstructure evolution indirectly or
simply discard microstructure information. Modern materials science, on the
other hand, seeks quantitive descriptions for the relations between
microstrucutre and loading response. In the present work, we show a promising
mesoscale phase-field framework which can describe co-evolution of phase/grain
and defect microstructures, reveal microstructure mechanisms and simultaneously
predict deformation properties as a natural outcome of microstrucuture
interactions. The energy functionals for phase/grain and defect microstructures

In the short term perspective (in one cycle), dislocations move back and forth,
leading to cyclic loops consistent with characteristics observed in

mobility. These mobilities are known to be notably complex when it comes to
describe the random walk of dislocation loops formed for example irradiated
materials: they may undergo 1D random excursions on their glide cylinder prior
to a rotation of their Burger's vector. The overall is often described as a
""mixed 1D to 3D"" mobility (noted here 1DR) for which cluster sink strengths
(CSS) expression exist in the literature but only with respect to a fixed sink.
In this paper we first review all the available CSS expressions for the all the
relevant combinations of reaction partners mobilities for a complete

treat crucial missing cases such as the interaction between two 1D-mobile
species in the general case. The analysis relies on exploiting the equivalence
(under specified conditions) between $1D-1D$ absorption rates and a 2D one with
respect to a fixed sink. Further exploiting the implications of this analogy,
we show that the CSS are expected to evolve with diffusion coefficient ratio of
both species elevated at exponents which are characteristic of the
dimensionality of both random walks. These terms may completely change the
magnitude of CSS compared to the pure 3D-CSS expression, whereas the other
terms of the CSS can have a quite comparable magnitude in both cases. These CSS
expressions are established for all combinations of either purely 3D or purely

Okamoto, K. Watanabe, A. Hirata, T. Egami, E. Saitoh, M. W. Chen"," Spin-charge conversion via inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is essential for
enabling various applications of spintronics. The spin Hall response usually
follows a universal scaling relation with longitudinal electric resistivity and
has mild temperature dependence because elementary excitations play only a
minor role in resistivity and hence ISHE. Here we report that the ISHE of
metallic glasses shows nearly two orders of magnitude enhancements with
temperature increase from a threshold of 80-100 K to glass transition points.
As electric resistivity changes only marginally in the temperature range, the
anomalous temperature dependence is in defiance of the prevailing scaling law.
Such a giant temperature enhancement can be well described by a two-level
thermal excitation model of glasses and disappears after crystallization,
suggesting a new mechanism which involves unique thermal excitations of
glasses. This finding may pave new ways to achieve high spin-charge conversion
efficiency at room and higher temperatures for spintronic devices and to detect
structure and dynamics of glasses using spin currents.

The effect of pressure on La$_{1.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoIrO$_{6}$ re-entrant  spin-glass","L. T. Coutrim, E. M. Bittar, L. Mendonça-Ferreira, L. Bufaiçal"," La$_{1.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoIrO$_{6}$ is a re-entrant spin-glass (SG) that exhibits

Electron-hole correlations govern Auger recombination in nanostructures","John P. Philbin, Eran Rabani"," The fast nonradiative decay of multiexcitonic states via Auger recombination
is a fundamental process affecting a variety of applications based on
semiconductor nanostructures. From a theoretical perspective, the description
of Auger recombination in confined semiconductor nanostructures is a
challenging task due to the large number of valance electrons and exponentially
growing number of excited excitonic and biexcitonic states that are coupled by
the Coulomb interaction. These challenges have restricted the treatment of
Auger recombination to simple, noninteracting electron-hole models. Herein we
present a novel approach for calculating Auger recombination lifetimes in
confined nanostructures having thousands to tens of thousands of electrons,
explicitly including electron-hole interactions. We demonstrate that the
inclusion of electron-hole correlations are imperative to capture the correct
scaling of the Auger recombination lifetime with the size and shape of the
nanostructure. In addition, correlation effects are required to obtain
quantitatively accurate lifetimes even for systems smaller than the exciton
Bohr radius. Neglecting such correlations can result in lifetimes that are 2
orders of magnitude too long. We establish the utility of the new approach for
CdSe quantum dots of varying sizes and for CdSe nanorods of varying diameters
and lengths. Our new approach is the first theoretical method to postdict the
experimentally known universal volume scaling law for quantum dots and makes
novel predictions for the scaling of the Auger recombination lifetimes in
nanorods.

Correlations and electronic order in a two-orbital honeycomb lattice  model for twisted bilayer graphene","Jörn W. F. Venderbos, Rafael M. Fernandes"," The recent observation of superconductivity in proximity to an insulating
phase in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at small `magic' twist angles has been
linked to the existence of nearly-flat bands, which make TBG a fresh playground
to investigate the interplay between correlations and superconductivity. The
low-energy narrow bands were shown to be well-described by an effective
tight-binding model on the honeycomb lattice (the dual of the triangular
Moir\'e superlattice) with a local orbital degree of freedom. In this paper, we
perform a strong-coupling analysis of the proposed $\left(p_{x},\,p_{y}\right)$
two-orbital extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. By decomposing the
interacting terms in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels, we
classify the different possible superconducting, magnetic, and charge
instabilities of the system. In the pairing case, we pay particular attention
to the two-component ($d$-wave) pairing channels, which admit vestigial phases
with nematic or chiral orders, and study their phenomenology. Furthermore, we
explore the strong-regime by obtaining a simplified spin-orbital exchange model
which may describe a putative Mott-like insulating state at quarter-filling.
Our mean-field solution reveals a rich intertwinement between ferro- and
antiferro-magnetic orders with different types of nematic and magnetic orbital
orders. Overall, our work provides a solid framework for further investigations
of the phase diagram of the two-orbital extended Hubbard model in both strong-

Phonon excitation and energy redistribution in phonon space for energy  transport in one-dimensional lattice with nonlinear dispersion",Zhijie Xu," We first propose fundamental solutions of wave propagation in one-dimensional
dispersive chain subject to a localized initial perturbation in the
displacement. Analytical solutions are obtained for both second order nonlinear
dispersive chain and homogenous harmonic chain. Solution was also compared with
numerical results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Locally dominant
phonon modes (k-space) are introduced based on these solutions. These locally
defined phonon modes k(x,t) spatially and temporally varying with x and t are
critical to the establishment of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The
establishment of LTE should require a uniform distribution of energy in these
modes at any given time t and location x. Wave propagation accompanying with
the nonequilibrium dynamics leads to the excitation of these locally defined
phonon modes. It was found that the system energy is redistributed among these
excited phonons modes (k-space). This redistribution process is only possible
with nonlinear dispersion and requires a finite amount of time to achieve a
steady state distribution depending on the spatial distribution (or frequency
content) of initial perturbation and the dispersion relation, where sharper and
concentrated perturbation leads to a faster redistribution. Ballistic type of
heat transport along the harmonic chain reveals that at any given position the
lowest mode (k=0) is excited first and gradually expanding to the highest mode,
which can only asymptotically approach the maximum mode of the first Brillouin
zone. Energy is shown to be uniformly distributed in all available phonon modes
lower than the highest mode. The energy flux along the chain is shown to be a
constant with time and proportional to the sound speed (ballistic transport).
Comparison with the Fourier's law leads to a time-dependent thermal
conductivity that diverges with time.

we interpret the constant $\theta$ as a novel topological property of vacuum, a
so called $\theta$-vacuum, and restrict our discussion to the cases where the
permittivity and the permeability of the media is one. In this way we
concentrate upon the effects of the additional $\theta$ coupling which induce
remarkable magnetoelectric effects. The issue of boundary conditions for

Satisfied-Defect, Unsatisfied-Cooperate: A Novel Evolutionary Dynamics  of Cooperation Led by Aspiration","Ik Soo Lim, Peter Wittek"," The evolutionary game theory has been widely used to study the evolution of
cooperation in social dilemmas where imitation-led strategy updates are

Geometrically, the pseudo-magnetic field is proportional to the Gaussian

Uniformly-moving non-singular dislocations with ellipsoidal core shape  in anisotropic media",Yves-Patrick Pellegrini," To allow for `relativistic'-like core contraction effects, an anisotropic
regularization of steadily-moving rectilinear dislocations of arbitrary
orientation is introduced, with two scale parameters $a_\parallel$ and
$a_\perp$ along the direction of motion and transverse to it, respectively. The
dislocation core is ellipsoidal. When $a_\perp/a_\parallel\to 0$, the model
reduces to the Peierls-Eshelby dislocation, the fields of which are
non-differentiable on the slip plane. For finite $a_\parallel$ and $a_\perp$,
fields are everywhere differentiable. Applying the author's so-called `causal'
Stroh formalism to the model, explicit expressions for the regularized fields
in anisotropic elasticity are derived for any velocity. For faster-than-wave
velocities, Mach-cone angles are found insensitive to the ratio
$a_\parallel/a_\perp$, as must be. However, the larger $a_\parallel$, the
weaker the intensity of the cone branches. An expression is given for the
radiative dissipative force opposed to motion. From this expression, it is
inferred that the concept of a `radiation-free' intersonic velocity can, when
not applicable, be replaced by that of a `least-radiation' velocity.

High-Performance Multi-Mode Ptychography Reconstruction on Distributed  GPUs","Zhihua Dong, Yao-Lung L. Fang, Xiaojing Huang, Hanfei Yan, Sungsoo Ha, Wei Xu, Yong S. Chu, Stuart I. Campbell, Meifeng Lin"," Ptychography is an emerging imaging technique that is able to provide
wavelength-limited spatial resolution from specimen with extended lateral

superposition of multiple classically distinct states, marks one of the
fundamental departures from classical physics. Quantum coherence has recently
been investigated rigorously within a resource-theoretic formalism. However,
the finer-grained notion of multilevel coherence, which explicitly takes into
account the number of superposed classical states, has remained relatively
unexplored. A comprehensive analysis of multi-level coherence, which acts as
the single-party analogue to multi-partite entanglement, is essential for
understanding natural quantum processes as well as for gauging the performance
of quantum technologies. Here we develop the theoretical and experimental
groundwork for characterizing and quantifying multilevel coherence. We prove
that non-trivial levels of purity are required for multilevel coherence, as
there is a ball of states around the maximally mixed state that do not exhibit
multilevel coherence in any basis. We provide a simple necessary and sufficient
analytical criterion to verify multilevel coherence, which leads to a complete
classification for three-level systems. We present the robustness of multilevel
coherence, a bona fide quantifier which we show to be numerically computable

Tunneling of Micro-sized Droplets Through a Flowing Soap Film","Ildoo Kim, X.L. Wu"," When a micron-sized water droplet impacts on a freely suspended soap film

the impact whereas with $v_{i}>v_{C}$, it tunnels through. In all cases, the
film remains intact despite the fact that the droplet radius ($R_{0}=26\,\mu

Exact edge, bulk and bound states of finite topological systems","Callum W. Duncan, Patrik Öhberg, Manuel Valiente"," Finite topologically non-trivial systems are often characterised by the
presence of bound states at their physical edges. These topological edge modes
can be distinguished from usual Shockley waves energetically, as their energies
remain finite and in-gap. On a clean 1D or reducible 2D model, in either the
commensurate or semi-infinite case, the edge modes can be obtained
analytically, as shown in [PRL 71, 3697 (1993)] and [PRA 89, 023619 (2014)]. We
put forward a method for obtaining the spectrum and wave functions of
topological edge modes for arbitrary finite lattices, including the
incommensurate case. A small number of parameters are easily determined
numerically, with the form of the eigenstates remaining fully analytical. We
also obtain the bulk modes in the finite system analytically and their
eigenenergies, which lie within the infinite-size limit continuum. Our method
is general and can be easily applied to obtain the properties of
non-topological models and/or extended to include impurities. As an example, we
consider the case of an impurity located next to one edge of a 1D system,
equivalent to a softened boundary in a separable 2D model. We show that a
localised impurity can have a drastic effect on the edge modes of the system.
Using the periodic Harper and Hofstadter models to illustrate our method, we
find that, on increasing the impurity strength, edge states can enter or exit
the continuum, and a trivial Shockley state bound to the impurity may appear.
The fate of the topological edge modes in the presence of impurities can be
addressed by quenching the impurity strength. We find that at certain critical
impurity strengths, the transition probability for a particle initially
prepared in an edge mode to decay into the bulk exhibits discontinuities that
mark the entry and exit points of edge modes from and into the bulk spectrum.

Momentum-space and real-space Berry curvatures in Mn$_{3}$Sn","Xiaokang Li, Liangcai Xu, Huakun Zuo, Alaska Subedi, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia"," Mn$_{3}$X (X= Sn, Ge) are non-collinear antiferromagnets hosting a large
anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Weyl nodes in the electronic dispersions are
believed to cause this AHE, but their locus in the momentum space is yet to be
pinned down. we present a detailed study of the Hall conductivity tensor and
magnetization in Mn$_{3}$Sn crystals and find that in the presence of a
moderate magnetic field, spin texture sets the orientation of the $k$-space
Berry curvature with no detectable in-plane anisotropy due to the $Z_6$
symmetry of the underlying lattice. We quantify the energy cost of domain
nucleation and show that the multi-domain regime is restricted to a narrow
field window. Comparing the field-dependence of AHE and magnetization, we find
indirect evidence for real-space Berry curvature caused by these domain walls.

Collective power: Minimal model for thermodynamics of nonequilibrium  phase transitions","Tim Herpich, Juzar Thingna, Massimiliano Esposito"," We propose a thermodynamically consistent minimal model to study
synchronization which is made of driven and interacting three-state units. This
system exhibits at the mean-field level two bifurcations separating three
dynamical phases: a single stable fixed point, a stable limit cycle indicative
of synchronization, and multiple stable fixed points. These complex emergent
dynamical behaviors are understood at the level of the underlying linear
Markovian dynamics in terms of metastability, i.e. the appearance of gaps in
the upper real part of the spectrum of the Markov generator. Stochastic
thermodynamics is used to study the dissipated work across dynamical phases as
well as across scales. This dissipated work is found to be reduced by the
attractive interactions between the units and to nontrivially depend on the
system size. When operating as a work-to-work converter, we find that the
maximum power output is achieved far-from-equilibrium in the synchronization
regime and that the efficiency at maximum power is surprisingly close to the
linear regime prediction. Our work shows the way towards building a
thermodynamics of nonequilibrium phase transitions in conjunction to
bifurcation theory.

Quench Dynamics of Finite Bosonic Ensembles in Optical Lattices with  Spatially Modulated Interactions","T. Plaßmann, S. I. Mistakidis, P. Schmelcher"," The nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of few boson ensembles which experience a
spatially modulated interaction strength and are confined in finite optical
lattices is investigated. We utilize a cosinusoidal spatially modulated
effective interaction strength which is characterized by its wavevector,
inhomogeneity amplitude, interaction offset and a phase. Performing quenches
either on the wavevector or the phase of the interaction profile an enhanced
imbalance of the interatomic repulsion between distinct spatial regions of the
lattice is induced. Following both quench protocols triggers various tunneling
channels and a rich excitation dynamics consisting of a breathing and a cradle
mode. All modes are shown to be amplified for increasing inhomogeneity
amplitude of the interaction strength. Especially the phase quench induces a
directional transport enabling us to discern energetically, otherwise,
degenerate tunneling pathways. Moreover, a periodic population transfer between
distinct momenta for quenches of increasing wavevector is observed, while a
directed occupation of higher momenta can be achieved following a phase quench.
Finally, during the evolution regions of partial coherence are revealed between
the predominantly occupied wells.

Building Maps in Collective Variable Space","Ilaria Gimondi, Gareth A. Tribello, Matteo Salvalaglio"," Enhanced sampling techniques such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics are
now routinely used to provide information on how the thermodynamic potential,

energy surfaces that one extracts by using these techniques provide a
simplified or coarse-grained representation of the configurational ensemble. In
this work we discuss how auxiliary variables can be mapped in collective
variable (CV) space and how the dependence of the average value of a function
of the atomic coordinates on the value of a small number of CVs can thus be
visualised. We show that these maps allow one to analyse both the physics of
the molecular system under investigation and the quality of the reduced
representation of the system that is encoded in a set of CVs. We apply this
approach to analyse the degeneracy of CVs and to compute entropy and enthalpy
surfaces in CV space both for conformational transitions in alanine dipeptide

Rotation-symmetry-enforced coupling of spin and angular momentum for  p-orbital bosons","Yongqiang Li, Jianmin Yuan, Andreas Hemmerich, Xiaopeng Li"," Intrinsic spin angular-momentum coupling of an electron has a relativistic
quantum origin with the coupling arising from charged-orbits, which does not
carry over to charge-neutral atoms. Here we propose a mechanism of spontaneous
generation of spin angular-momentum coupling with spinor atomic bosons loaded
into $p$-orbital bands of a two-dimensional optical-lattice. This spin
angular-momentum coupling originates from many-body correlations and
spontaneous symmetry breaking in a superfluid, with the key ingredients
attributed to spin-channel quantum fluctuations and an approximate rotation
symmetry. The resultant spin angular-momentum intertwined superfluid has Dirac
excitations. In presence of a chemical potential difference for adjacent sites,
it provides a bosonic analogue of a symmetry-protected-topological insulator.
Through a dynamical mean-field calculation, this novel superfluid is found to
be a generic low-temperature phase, and it gives way to Mott localization only
at strong interactions and even-integer fillings. We show the temperature to
reach this order is accessible with present experiments.

Emergent dimerization and localization in disordered quantum chains","André P. Vieira, José A. Hoyos"," We uncover a novel mechanism for inducing a gapful phase in interacting

system from criticality and stabilizes the novel phase. This mechanism is shown
to be quite general in strongly interacting quantum chains in the presence of
strongly modulated quasiperiodic disorder which is, surprisingly,
perturbatively irrelevant. Finally, we also characterize the associated quantum

Spin manipulation and spin dephasing in quantum dot integrated with a  general slanting magnetic field",Rui Li," A slanting magnetic field is usually used to realize a slight hybridization
between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom in a semiconductor quantum dot,
such that the spin is manipulable by an external oscillating electric-field.
Here we show that, the longitudinal slanting field mediates a longitudinal
driving term in the electric-dipole spin resonance, such that the spin
population inversion exhibits a modulated Rabi oscillation. Fortunately, we can
reduce this modulation by increasing the static magnetic field. The
longitudinal slanting field also mediates a spin-1/f-charge noise interaction,
which causes the pure dephasing of the spin qubit. Choosing proper spectrum
function strength, we find the spin dephasing time is about ${\rm
T}^{*}_{2}=20$ $\mu$s and the spin echo time is about ${\rm T}^{\rm
echo}_{2}=100$ $\mu$s in a Si quantum dot. We also propose several strategies
to alleviate the spin dephasing, such as lowering the experimental temperature,
reducing the quantum dot size, engineering the slanting field, or using the
dynamical decoupling scheme.

One-dimensional many-body entangled open quantum systems with tensor  network methods","Daniel Jaschke, Simone Montangero, Lincoln D. Carr"," We present a collection of methods to simulate entangled dynamics of open
quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation with tensor network methods.
Tensor network methods using matrix product states have been proven very useful
to simulate many-body quantum systems and have driven many innovations in
research. Since the matrix product state design is tailored for closed
one-dimensional systems governed by the Schr\""odinger equation, the next step
for many-body quantum dynamics is the simulation of open quantum systems. We
review the three dominant approaches to the simulation of open quantum systems
via the Lindblad master equation: quantum trajectories, matrix product density
operators, and locally purified tensor networks. Selected examples guide
possible applications of the methods and serve moreover as a benchmark between
the techniques. These examples include the finite temperature states of the
transverse quantum Ising model, the dynamics of an exciton traveling under the
influence of spontaneous emission and dephasing, and a double-well potential
simulated with the Bose-Hubbard model including dephasing. We analyze which
approach is favorable leading to the conclusion that a complete set of all
three methods is most beneficial, push- ing the limits of different scenarios.
The convergence studies using analytical results for macroscopic variables and
exact diagonalization methods as comparison, show, for example, that matrix
product density operators are favorable for the exciton problem in our study.
All three methods access the same library, i.e., the software package Open
Source Matrix Product States, allowing us to have a meaningful comparison
between the approaches based on the selected examples. For example, tensor
operations are accessed from the same subroutines and with the same
optimization eliminating one possible bias in a comparison of such numerical

interaction mediated by electron-phonon coupling, but the flat-band nature of
the excitation spectrum makes also superconductivity quite unusual. For
example, as the flat-band states are highly localized around certain spots in

we show that the degree of active noise driving forced cell rearrangements
governs the stress-relaxation time-scale of the tissue. We study tissue
response to in-plane shear at different time scales. At short time, the tissue
behaves as a solid, whereas its long-time fluid behavior can be associated with
an effective viscosity which scales with the rate of active T1 transformations.
Furthermore, we develop a coarse-grained theory, where we treat the tissue as
an active fluid and confirm the results of the vertex model. The impact of cell
rearrangements on tissue shape is illustrated by studying axial compression of

Condition for the emergence of a bulk Fermi arc in disordered  Dirac-fermion systems","Peng-Lu Zhao, An-Min Wang, Guo-Zhu Liu"," We present a renormalization group analysis of the disorder effects on the
low-energy behaviors of twodimensional tilted Dirac-fermion systems, in which
the fermions have two distinct orbitals unrelated by any symmetry. Four types
of disordered potential, two interorbital and two intraorbital, are considered.
If there is only one type of interorbital disorder, the fermion-disorder
scattering induces logarithmic or power-law corrections to the fermion density
of states and specific heat. In contrast, the intraorbital disorder can turn
the system into a strongly disordered phase. In this disordered phase,
calculations based on self-consistent Born approximation reveal that the Dirac
point is destroyed and replaced by a bulk Fermi arc. We also study the
interplay of four types of disorder, and find that the Dirac point can either
remain intact or give place to a Fermi arc. We obtain the condition for the
emergence of a Fermi arc in this case. Our results indicate that disorders can

two features of superconductivity arising from an IM normal state: First,
despite the absence of quasiparticles in the normal state, the superconducting

non-quasiparticle nature of the IM Green's functions produces a large

Anomaly and global inconsistency matching: $θ$-angles,  $SU(3)/U(1)^2$ nonlinear sigma model, $SU(3)$ chains and its generalizations","Yuya Tanizaki, Tin Sulejmanpasic"," We discuss the $SU(3)/[U(1)\times U(1)]$ nonlinear sigma model in 1+1D and,
more broadly, its linearized counterparts. Such theories can be expressed as
$U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories and therefore allow for two topological
$\theta$-angles. These models provide a field theoretic description of the
$SU(3)$ chains. We show that, for particular values of $\theta$-angles, a
global symmetry group of such systems has a 't Hooft anomaly, which manifests
itself as an inability to gauge the global symmetry group. By applying anomaly
matching, the ground-state properties can be severely constrained. The anomaly
matching is an avatar of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem for the spin
chain from which the field theory descends, and it forbids a trivially gapped
ground state for particular $\theta$-angles. We generalize the statement of the
LSM theorem and show that 't Hooft anomalies persist even under perturbations
which break the spin-symmetry down to the discrete subgroup $\mathbb
Z_3\times\mathbb Z_3\subset SU(3)/\mathbb Z_3$. In addition the model can
further be constrained by applying global inconsistency matching, which
indicates the presence of a phase transition between different regions of
$\theta$-angles. We use these constraints to give possible scenarios of the
phase diagram. We also argue that at the special points of the phase diagram
the anomalies are matched by the $SU(3)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We
generalize the discussion to the $SU(N)/U(1)^{N-1}$ nonlinear sigma models as
well as the 't Hooft anomaly of the $SU(N)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model, and show
that they match. Finally the $(2+1)$-dimensional extension is considered

nontrivial consequences.

Revising and Extending the Linear Response Theory for Statistical  Mechanical Systems: Evaluating Observables as Predictors and Predictands",Valerio Lucarini," Linear response theory has developed into a formidable set of tools for
studying the forced behaviour of a large variety of systems - including out of
equilibrium ones. In this paper we provide a new angle on the problem, by
studying under which conditions it is possible to perform predictions on the
response of a given observable of a system to perturbations, using one or more
other observables of the same system as predictors, and thus bypassing the need
to know all the details of the acting forcing. Thus, we break the rigid
separation between forcing and response, which is key in linear response
theory, and revisit the concept of causality. As a result, the surrogate Green
functions one constructs for predicting the response of the observable of
interest may have support that is not necessarily limited to the nonnegative
time axis. This implies that not all observables are equally good as
predictands when a given forcing is applied, as result of the properties of
their corresponding susceptibility. In particular, problems emerge from the
presence of complex zeros. We derive general explicit formulas that, in absence
of such pathologies, allow one to reconstruct the response of an observable of
interest to N independent forcings by using as predictors N other observables.
We provide a thorough test of the theory and of the possible pathologies by
using numerical simulations of the paradigmatic Lorenz '96 model. Our results
are potentially relevant for problems like the reconstruction of data from
proxy signals, like in the case of paleoclimate, and, in general, the analysis
of signals and feedbacks in complex systems where our knowledge on the system
is limited, as in neurosciences. Our technique might also be useful for
reconstructing the response to forcings of a spatially extended system in a
given location by looking at the response in a separate location.

Field-free Magnetization Switching by Utilizing the Spin Hall Effect and  Interlayer Exchange Coupling of Iridium","Yang Liu, Bing Zhou, Jian-Gang Zhu"," Magnetization switching by spin-orbit torque (SOT) via spin Hall effect

Hall effect, but also induce interlayer exchange coupling with an in-plane
magnetic layer that eliminates the need for the external field. Such dual
functions of the Ir layer allows future build-up of magnetoresistive stacks for
memory and logic applications. Experimental observations show that the SOT

Failure of Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem and fragile topology in  two-dimensional systems with space-time inversion symmetry: application to  twisted bilayer graphene at magic angle","Junyeong Ahn, Sungjoon Park, Bohm-Jung Yang"," We show that the Wannier obstruction and the fragile topology of the nearly
flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene at magic angle are manifestations of the
nontrivial topology of two-dimensional real wave functions characterized by the
Euler class. To prove this, we examine the generic band topology of two
dimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$
symmetry. The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real
two band systems. We show that a two-band system with a nonzero Euler class
cannot have $I_{ST}$-symmetric Wannier representation. Moreover, a two-band
system with the Euler class $e_{2}$ has band crossing points whose total
winding number is equal to $2e_2$. Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya
theorem fails in systems with a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the
topological phase transition between two insulators carrying distinct Euler
classes can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation of
vortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings. When the
number of bands is bigger than two, there is a $Z_{2}$ topological invariant
classifying the band topology, that is, the second Stiefel Whitney class
($w_2$). Two bands with an even (odd) Euler class turn into a system with
$w_2=0$ ($w_2=1$) when additional trivial bands are added. Although the
nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney class remains robust against adding trivial
bands, it does not impose Wannier obstruction when the number of bands is
bigger than two. However, when the resulting multi-band system with the
nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney class is supplemented by additional mirror
and chiral symmetries, a nontrivial second order topology and the associated

by coupling a recent model for discontinuous shear thickening and the
`suspension balance model' for solvent permeation through particles.
