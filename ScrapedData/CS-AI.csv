ExpIt-OOS: Towards Learning from Planning in Imperfect Information Games","Andy Kitchen, Michela Benedetti"," The current state of the art in playing many important perfect information
games, including Chess and Go, combines planning and deep reinforcement
learning with self-play. We extend this approach to imperfect information games
and present ExIt-OOS, a novel approach to playing imperfect information games
within the Expert Iteration framework and inspired by AlphaZero. We use Online
Outcome Sampling, an online search algorithm for imperfect information games in
place of MCTS. While training online, our neural strategy is used to improve
the accuracy of playouts in OOS, allowing a learning and planning feedback loop
for imperfect information games.

Rule-based OWL Modeling with ROWLTab Protege Plugin","Md. Kamruzzaman Sarker, Adila Krisnadhi, David Carral, Pascal Hitzler"," It has been argued that it is much easier to convey logical statements using
rules rather than OWL (or description logic (DL)) axioms. Based on recent
theoretical developments on transformations between rules and DLs, we have
developed ROWLTab, a Protege plugin that allows users to enter OWL axioms by
way of rules; the plugin then automatically converts these rules into OWL 2 DL
axioms if possible, and prompts the user in case such a conversion is not
possible without weakening the semantics of the rule. In this paper, we present
ROWLTab, together with a user evaluation of its effectiveness compared to
entering axioms using the standard Protege interface. Our evaluation shows that
modeling with ROWLTab is much quicker than the standard interface, while at the
same time, also less prone to errors for hard modeling tasks.

Reasoning about Actions and State Changes by Injecting Commonsense  Knowledge","Niket Tandon, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Joel Grus, Wen-tau Yih, Antoine Bosselut, Peter Clark"," Comprehending procedural text, e.g., a paragraph describing photosynthesis,
requires modeling actions and the state changes they produce, so that questions
about entities at different timepoints can be answered. Although several recent
systems have shown impressive progress in this task, their predictions can be
globally inconsistent or highly improbable. In this paper, we show how the
predicted effects of actions in the context of a paragraph can be improved in
two ways: (1) by incorporating global, commonsense constraints (e.g., a
non-existent entity cannot be destroyed), and (2) by biasing reading with
preferences from large-scale corpora (e.g., trees rarely move). Unlike earlier
methods, we treat the problem as a neural structured prediction task, allowing
hard and soft constraints to steer the model away from unlikely predictions. We
show that the new model significantly outperforms earlier systems on a
benchmark dataset for procedural text comprehension (+8% relative gain), and
that it also avoids some of the nonsensical predictions that earlier systems
make.

Learning End-to-end Autonomous Driving using Guided Auxiliary  Supervision","Ashish Mehta, Adithya Subramanian, Anbumani Subramanian"," Learning to drive faithfully in highly stochastic urban settings remains an
open problem. To that end, we propose a Multi-task Learning from Demonstration
(MT-LfD) framework which uses supervised auxiliary task prediction to guide the
main task of predicting the driving commands. Our framework involves an
end-to-end trainable network for imitating the expert demonstrator's driving
commands. The network intermediately predicts visual affordances and action
primitives through direct supervision which provide the aforementioned
auxiliary supervised guidance. We demonstrate that such joint learning and
supervised guidance facilitates hierarchical task decomposition, assisting the
agent to learn faster, achieve better driving performance and increases
transparency of the otherwise black-box end-to-end network. We run our
experiments to validate the MT-LfD framework in CARLA, an open-source urban
driving simulator. We introduce multiple non-player agents in CARLA and induce
temporal noise in them for realistic stochasticity.

Robot_gym: accelerated robot training through simulation in the cloud  with ROS and Gazebo","Víctor Mayoral Vilches, Alejandro Hernández Cordero, Asier Bilbao Calvo, Irati Zamalloa Ugarte, Risto Kojcev"," Rather than programming, training allows robots to achieve behaviors that
generalize better and are capable to respond to real-world needs. However, such

roboticists' tools, simplifying the development and deployment processes on
real robots. We unveil that, for simple tasks, simple 3DoF robots require more
than 140 attempts to learn. For more complex, 6DoF robots, the number of
attempts increases to more than 900 for the same task. We demonstrate that our
framework, for simple tasks, accelerates the robot training time by more than
33% while maintaining similar levels of accuracy and repeatability.

Baidu Apollo Auto-Calibration System - An Industry-Level Data-Driven and  Learning based Vehicle Longitude Dynamic Calibrating Algorithm","Fan Zhu, Lin Ma, Xin Xu, Dingfeng Guo, Xiao Cui, Qi Kong"," For any autonomous driving vehicle, control module determines its road
performance and safety, i.e. its precision and stability should stay within a
carefully-designed range. Nonetheless, control algorithms require vehicle
dynamics (such as longitudinal dynamics) as inputs, which, unfortunately, are
obscure to calibrate in real time. As a result, to achieve reasonable
performance, most, if not all, research-oriented autonomous vehicles do manual
calibrations in a one-by-one fashion. Since manual calibration is not
sustainable once entering into mass production stage for industrial purposes,
we here introduce a machine-learning based auto-calibration system for
autonomous driving vehicles. In this paper, we will show how we build a
data-driven longitudinal calibration procedure using machine learning
techniques. We first generated offline calibration tables from human driving
data. The offline table serves as an initial guess for later uses and it only
needs twenty-minutes data collection and process. We then used an
online-learning algorithm to appropriately update the initial table (the
offline table) based on real-time performance analysis. This longitudinal
auto-calibration system has been deployed to more than one hundred Baidu Apollo
self-driving vehicles (including hybrid family vehicles and electronic
delivery-only vehicles) since April 2018. By August 27, 2018, it had been
tested for more than two thousands hours, ten thousands kilometers (6,213
miles) and yet proven to be effective.

Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog with Multiple Answers","Janarthanan Rajendran, Jatin Ganhotra, Satinder Singh, Lazaros Polymenakos"," In a dialog, there can be multiple valid next utterances at any point. The
present end-to-end neural methods for dialog do not take this into account.
They learn with the assumption that at any time there is only one correct next
utterance. In this work, we focus on this problem in the goal-oriented dialog
setting where there are different paths to reach a goal. We propose a new
method, that uses a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement
learning approaches to address this issue. We also propose a new and more
effective testbed, permuted-bAbI dialog tasks, by introducing multiple valid
next utterances to the original-bAbI dialog tasks, which allows evaluation of
goal-oriented dialog systems in a more realistic setting. We show that there is
a significant drop in performance of existing end-to-end neural methods from
81.5% per-dialog accuracy on original-bAbI dialog tasks to 30.3% on
permuted-bAbI dialog tasks. We also show that our proposed method improves the
performance and achieves 47.3% per-dialog accuracy on permuted-bAbI dialog
tasks.

Modelling Langford's Problem: A Viewpoint for Search","Özgür Akgün, Ian Miguel"," The performance of enumerating all solutions to an instance of Langford's
Problem is sensitive to the model and the search strategy. In this paper we

viewpoints. We empirically show that a channelled model with a static branching
order on one of the viewpoints offers the best performance out of all the
options we consider. Surprisingly, one of the base models proves very effective
for propagation, while the other provides an effective means of stating a

An Efficient Matheuristic for the Minimum-Weight Dominating Set Problem","Mayra Albuquerque, Thibaut Vidal"," A minimum dominating set in a graph is a minimum set of vertices such that
every vertex of the graph either belongs to it, or is adjacent to one vertex of
this set. This mathematical object is of high relevance in a number of
applications related to social networks analysis, design of wireless networks,
coding theory, and data mining, among many others. When vertex weights are
given, minimizing the total weight of the dominating set gives rise to a
problem variant known as the minimum weight dominating set problem. To solve
this problem, we introduce a hybrid matheuristic combining a tabu search with
an integer programming solver. The latter is used to solve subproblems in which
only a fraction of the decision variables, selected relatively to the search
history, are left free while the others are fixed. Moreover, we introduce an
adaptive penalty to promote the exploration of intermediate infeasible
solutions during the search, enhance the algorithm with perturbations and node
elimination procedures, and exploit richer neighborhood classes. Extensive
experimental analyses on a variety of instance classes demonstrate the good
performance of the algorithm, and the contribution of each component in the
success of the search is analyzed.

Neural Compositional Denotational Semantics for Question Answering","Nitish Gupta, Mike Lewis"," Answering compositional questions requiring multi-step reasoning is
challenging. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for interpreting
questions about a knowledge graph (KG), which is inspired by formal approaches
to semantics. Each span of text is represented by a denotation in a KG and a
vector that captures ungrounded aspects of meaning. Learned composition modules
recursively combine constituent spans, culminating in a grounding for the
complete sentence which answers the question. For example, to interpret ""not
green"", the model represents ""green"" as a set of KG entities and ""not"" as a
trainable ungrounded vector---and then uses this vector to parameterize a
composition function that performs a complement operation. For each sentence,
we build a parse chart subsuming all possible parses, allowing the model to
jointly learn both the composition operators and output structure by gradient
descent from end-task supervision. The model learns a variety of challenging
semantic operators, such as quantifiers, disjunctions and composed relations,
and infers latent syntactic structure. It also generalizes well to longer
questions than seen in its training data, in contrast to RNN, its tree-based
variants, and semantic parsing baselines.

learning. First, from WordNet, we automatically construct a semantic knowledge
base called DisDict, which provides refined feature words that highlight the
differences among word senses, i.e., synsets. Second, we automatically generate
new sense-labeled data by DisDict from unlabeled corpora. Third, these
generated data, together with manually labeled data and unlabeled data, are fed
to a neural framework conducting supervised and unsupervised learning jointly
to model the semantic relations among synsets, feature words and their
contexts. The experimental results show that KDSL outperforms several
representative state-of-the-art methods on various major benchmarks.
Interestingly, it performs relatively well even when manually labeled data is
unavailable, thus provides a new promising backoff strategy for WSD.

Approximate Exploration through State Abstraction","Adrien Ali Taïga, Aaron Courville, Marc G. Bellemare"," Although exploration in reinforcement learning is well understood from a
theoretical point of view, provably correct methods remain impractical. In this
paper we study the interplay between exploration and approximation, what we
call \emph{approximate exploration}. We first provide results when the
approximation is explicit, quantifying the performance of an exploration
algorithm, MBIE-EB \citep{strehl2008analysis}, when combined with state
aggregation. In particular, we show that this allows the agent to trade off
between learning speed and quality of the policy learned. We then turn to a
successful exploration scheme in practical, pseudo-count based exploration
bonuses \citep{bellemare2016unifying}. We show that choosing a density model
implicitly defines an abstraction and that the pseudo-count bonus incentivizes
the agent to explore using this abstraction. We find, however, that implicit
exploration may result in a mismatch between the approximated value function
and exploration bonus, leading to either under- or over-exploration.

MARL-FWC: Optimal Coordination of Freeway Traffic Control Measures","Ahmed Fares, Walid Gomaa, Mohamed A. Khamis"," The objective of this article is to optimize the overall traffic flow on
freeways using multiple ramp metering controls plus its complementary Dynamic
Speed Limits (DSLs). An optimal freeway operation can be reached when
minimizing the difference between the freeway density and the critical ratio
for maximum traffic flow. In this article, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

MARL-FWC introduces a new microscopic framework at the network level based on
collaborative Markov Decision Process modeling (Markov game) and an associated
cooperative Q-learning algorithm. The technique incorporates payoff propagation
(Max-Plus algorithm) under the coordination graphs framework, particularly
suited for optimal control purposes. MARL-FWC provides three control designs:
fully independent, fully distributed, and centralized; suited for different
network architectures. MARL-FWC was extensively tested in order to assess the
proposed model of the joint payoff, as well as the global payoff. Experiments
are conducted with heavy traffic flow under the renowned VISSIM traffic

decrease in the total travel time and an increase in the average speed (when
compared with the base case) while maintaining an optimal traffic flow.

A Particle Filter based Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm: PFOPS","Bin Liu, Yaochu Jin"," This letter is concerned with a recently developed paradigm of

Bridging Knowledge Gaps in Neural Entailment via Symbolic Models","Dongyeop Kang, Tushar Khot, Ashish Sabharwal, Peter Clark"," Most textual entailment models focus on lexical gaps between the premise text
and the hypothesis, but rarely on knowledge gaps. We focus on filling these
knowledge gaps in the Science Entailment task, by leveraging an external
structured knowledge base (KB) of science facts. Our new architecture combines
standard neural entailment models with a knowledge lookup module. To facilitate
this lookup, we propose a fact-level decomposition of the hypothesis, and
verifying the resulting sub-facts against both the textual premise and the
structured KB. Our model, NSnet, learns to aggregate predictions from these
heterogeneous data formats. On the SciTail dataset, NSnet outperforms a simpler
combination of the two predictions by 3% and the base entailment model by 5%.

Investigating Human + Machine Complementarity for Recidivism Predictions","Sarah Tan, Julius Adebayo, Kori Inkpen, Ece Kamar"," When might human input help (or not) when assessing risk in fairness-related
domains? Dressel and Farid asked Mechanical Turk workers to evaluate a subset
of individuals in the ProPublica COMPAS data set for risk of recidivism, and
concluded that COMPAS predictions were no more accurate or fair than
predictions made by humans. We delve deeper into this claim in this paper. We
construct a Human Risk Score based on the predictions made by multiple
Mechanical Turk workers on the same individual, study the agreement and
disagreement between COMPAS and Human Scores on subgroups of individuals, and
construct hybrid Human+AI models to predict recidivism. Our key finding is that
on this data set, human and COMPAS decision making differed, but not in ways
that could be leveraged to significantly improve ground truth prediction. We
present the results of our analyses and suggestions for how machine and human
input may have complementary strengths to address challenges in the fairness

Water Disaggregation via Shape Features based Bayesian Discriminative  Sparse Coding","Bingsheng Wang, Xuchao Zhang, Chang-Tien Lu, Feng Chen"," As the issue of freshwater shortage is increasing daily, it is critical to
take effective measures for water conservation. According to previous studies,
device level consumption could lead to significant freshwater conservation.
Existing water disaggregation methods focus on learning the signatures for
appliances; however, they are lack of the mechanism to accurately discriminate
parallel appliances' consumption. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
Discriminative Sparse Coding model using Laplace Prior (BDSC-LP) to extensively
enhance the disaggregation performance. To derive discriminative basis
functions, shape features are presented to describe the low-sampling-rate water
consumption patterns. A Gibbs sampling based inference method is designed to
extend the discriminative capability of the disaggregation dictionaries.

Autonomous Driving without a Burden: View from Outside with Elevated  LiDAR","Nalin Jayaweera, Nandana Rajatheva, Matti Latva-aho"," The current autonomous driving architecture places a heavy burden in signal
processing for the graphics processing units (GPUs) in the car. This directly
transforms into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in
electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and
other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor
at the top of the car which is an essential feature in todays autonomous
vehicles. LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to
make relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from
the car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as
Telsa. The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical
fields of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given
the smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a huge
amount of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which
becomes challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units
inside the car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed
cloud. However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are
difficult to be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a
coordinated set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an
integrated view with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized
decision making body which then sends the required control actions to the
vehicles with a lower bit rate in the downlink and with the required latency.
The calculations we have based on industry standard equipment from several
manufacturers show that this is not just a concept but a feasible system which
can be implemented.

An Incremental Construction of Deep Neuro Fuzzy System for Continual  Learning of Non-stationary Data Streams","Mahardhika Pratama, Witold Pedrycz, Geoffrey I. Webb"," Existing fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) are mostly developed under a shallow
network configuration having lower generalization power than those of deep
structures. This paper proposes a novel self-organizing deep fuzzy neural
network, namely deep evolving fuzzy neural networks (DEVFNN). Fuzzy rules can
be automatically extracted from data streams or removed if they play little
role during their lifespan. The structure of the network can be deepened on
demand by stacking additional layers using a drift detection method which not
only detects the covariate drift, variations of input space, but also
accurately identifies the real drift, dynamic changes of both feature space and
target space. DEVFNN is developed under the stacked generalization principle
via the feature augmentation concept where a recently developed algorithm,
namely Generic Classifier (gClass), drives the hidden layer. It is equipped by
an automatic feature selection method which controls activation and
deactivation of input attributes to induce varying subsets of input features. A
deep network simplification procedure is put forward using the concept of
hidden layer merging to prevent uncontrollable growth of input space dimension
due to the nature of feature augmentation approach in building a deep network
structure. DEVFNN works in the sample-wise fashion and is compatible for data
stream applications. The efficacy of DEVFNN has been thoroughly evaluated using
six datasets with non-stationary properties under the prequential
test-then-train protocol. It has been compared with four state-of the art data
stream methods and its shallow counterpart where DEVFNN demonstrates
improvement of classification accuracy.

Deep Emotion: A Computational Model of Emotion Using Deep Neural  Networks","Chie Hieida, Takato Horii, Takayuki Nagai"," Emotions are very important for human intelligence. For example, emotions are
closely related to the appraisal of the internal bodily state and external
stimuli. This helps us to respond quickly to the environment. Another important
perspective in human intelligence is the role of emotions in decision-making.
Moreover, the social aspect of emotions is also very important. Therefore, if
the mechanism of emotions were elucidated, we could advance toward the
essential understanding of our natural intelligence. In this study, a model of
emotions is proposed to elucidate the mechanism of emotions through the
computational model. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of partner robots, the
model of emotions may help us to build robots that can have empathy for humans.
To understand and sympathize with people's feelings, the robots need to have
their own emotions. This may allow robots to be accepted in human society. The
proposed model is implemented using deep neural networks consisting of three
modules, which interact with each other. Simulation results reveal that the
proposed model exhibits reasonable behavior as the basic mechanism of emotion.

Adaptive Grey-Box Fuzz-Testing with Thompson Sampling","Siddharth Karamcheti, Gideon Mann, David Rosenberg"," Fuzz testing, or ""fuzzing,"" refers to a widely deployed class of techniques
for testing programs by generating a set of inputs for the express purpose of
finding bugs and identifying security flaws. Grey-box fuzzing, the most popular
fuzzing strategy, combines light program instrumentation with a data driven
process to generate new program inputs. In this work, we present a machine
learning approach that builds on AFL, the preeminent grey-box fuzzer, by
adaptively learning a probability distribution over its mutation operators on a
program-specific basis. These operators, which are selected uniformly at random
in AFL and mutational fuzzers in general, dictate how new inputs are generated,
a core part of the fuzzer's efficacy. Our main contributions are two-fold:
First, we show that a sampling distribution over mutation operators estimated
from training programs can significantly improve performance of AFL. Second, we
introduce a Thompson Sampling, bandit-based optimization approach that
fine-tunes the mutator distribution adaptively, during the course of fuzzing an
individual program. A set of experiments across complex programs demonstrates
that tuning the mutational operator distribution generates sets of inputs that
yield significantly higher code coverage and finds more crashes faster and more
reliably than both baseline versions of AFL as well as other AFL-based learning
approaches.

Generalisation in humans and deep neural networks","Robert Geirhos, Carlos R. Medina Temme, Jonas Rauber, Heiko H. Schuett, Matthias Bethge, Felix A. Wichmann"," We compare the robustness of humans and current convolutional deep neural

tested on other distortion types. For example, training on salt-and-pepper
noise does not imply robustness on uniform white noise and vice versa. Thus,
changes in the noise distribution between training and testing constitutes a

Adversarially Regularising Neural NLI Models to Integrate Logical  Background Knowledge","Pasquale Minervini, Sebastian Riedel"," Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models designed to cause
the model to make a mistake. They are useful for understanding the shortcomings
of machine learning models, interpreting their results, and for regularisation.
In NLP, however, most example generation strategies produce input text by using
known, pre-specified semantic transformations, requiring significant manual
effort and in-depth understanding of the problem and domain. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of automatically generating adversarial examples that
violate a set of given First-Order Logic constraints in Natural Language
Inference (NLI). We reduce the problem of identifying such adversarial examples
to a combinatorial optimisation problem, by maximising a quantity measuring the
degree of violation of such constraints and by using a language model for
generating linguistically-plausible examples. Furthermore, we propose a method
for adversarially regularising neural NLI models for incorporating background

improve results on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets, it significantly and
consistently increases the predictive accuracy on adversarially-crafted
datasets -- up to a 79.6% relative improvement -- while drastically reducing
the number of background knowledge violations. Furthermore, we show that
adversarial examples transfer among model architectures, and that the proposed

cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches
have focused on learning image intensity features for segmentation, whereas the
incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention. In this
paper, we combine a multi-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to
develop a shape-constrained bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis
CMR volumetric images. The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network
(FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously.
The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining
the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of
addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy.
Moreover, the refinement step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape
constraint and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for
overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and
large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful
3D cardiac shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's
ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to
initialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects
and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical experiments
on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable
of producing accurate, high-resolution and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular

trial-and-error process that consumes a tremendous amount of time and computer

experts need to understand what has occurred in the training process and why
the resulting CNN behaves as such. However, current popular training platforms,
such as TensorFlow, only provide very little and general information, such as
training/validation errors, which is far from enough to serve this purpose. To

Brain Biomarker Interpretation in ASD Using Deep Learning and fMRI","Xiaoxiao Li, Nicha C. Dvornek, Juntang Zhuang, Pamela Ventola, James S. Duncan"," Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
Finding the biomarkers associated with ASD is extremely helpful to understand
the underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more
targeted treatment. Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify ASD, understanding the
data-driven computational decision making procedure has not been previously
explored. Therefore, in this work, we address the problem of interpreting
reliable biomarkers associated with identifying ASD; specifically, we propose a
2-stage method that classifies ASD and control subjects using fMRI images and
interprets the saliency features activated by the classifier. First, we trained
an accurate DNN classifier. Then, for detecting the biomarkers, different from
the DNN visualization works in computer vision, we take advantage of the
anatomical structure of brain fMRI and develop a frequency-normalized sampling
method to corrupt images. Furthermore, in the ASD vs. control subjects
classification scenario, we provide a new approach to detect and characterize
important brain features into three categories. The biomarkers we found by the
proposed method are robust and consistent with previous findings in the
literature. We also validate the detected biomarkers by neurological function
decoding and comparing with the DNN activation maps.

Controlling Over-generalization and its Effect on Adversarial Examples  Generation and Detection","Mahdieh Abbasi, Arezoo Rajabi, Azadeh Sadat Mozafari, Rakesh B. Bobba, Christian Gagne"," Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) allowed improving the state-of-the-art
for many vision applications. However, naive CNNs suffer from two serious
issues: vulnerability to adversarial examples and making incorrect but
confident predictions for out-distribution samples. In this paper, we draw a
connection between these two issues of CNNs through over-generalization. We
reveal an augmented CNN (an extra output class added) as a simple yet effective
end-to-end approach has the capacity for controlling over-generalization. We
demonstrate training an augmented CNN on only a properly selected natural
out-distribution dataset and interpolated samples empowers it to classify a
wide range of unseen out-distribution samples as dustbin. Meanwhile, its
misclassification rates on a broad spectrum of well-known black-box adversaries
drop drastically as it classifies a portion of adversaries as dustbin class
(rejection option) while correctly classifies some of the remaining. However,
such an augmented CNN is never trained with any types of adversaries. Finally,
generation of white-box adversarial attacks using augmented CNNs can be harder
as the attack algorithms have to avoid dustbin regions for generating actual
adversaries.

Future Automation Engineering using Structural Graph Convolutional  Neural Networks","Jiang Wan, Blake S. Pollard, Sujit Rokka Chhetri, Palash Goyal, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque, Arquimedes Canedo"," The digitalization of automation engineering generates large quantities of
engineering data that is interlinked in knowledge graphs. Classifying and
clustering subgraphs according to their functionality is useful to discover
functionally equivalent engineering artifacts that exhibit different graph
structures. This paper presents a new graph learning algorithm designed to
classify engineering data artifacts -- represented in the form of graphs --
according to their structure and neighborhood features. Our Structural Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (SGCNN) is capable of learning graphs and
subgraphs with a novel graph invariant convolution kernel and
downsampling/pooling algorithm. On a realistic engineering-related dataset, we
show that SGCNN is capable of achieving ~91% classification accuracy.

Ontology Reasoning with Deep Neural Networks","Patrick Hohenecker, Thomas Lukasiewicz"," The ability to conduct logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of
intelligent behavior, and thus an important problem along the way to
human-level artificial intelligence. Traditionally, symbolic methods from the
field of knowledge representation and reasoning have been used to equip agents
with capabilities that resemble human reasoning qualities. More recently,
however, there has been an increasing interest in applying alternative
approaches based on machine learning rather than logic-based formalisms to
tackle this kind of tasks. Here, we make use of state-of-the-art methods for
training deep neural networks to devise a novel model that is closely coupled
to symbolic reasoning methods, and thus able to learn how to effectively
perform basic ontology reasoning. This term describes an important and at the
same time very natural kind of problem settings where the rules for conducting
reasoning are specified alongside with the actual information. Many problems in
practice may be viewed as such reasoning tasks, which is why the presented
approach is applicable to a plethora of important real-world problems. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested method, we present the outcomes
of several experiments that have been conducted on both toy datasets as well as
real-world data, which show that our model learned to perform precise reasoning
on a number of diverse inference tasks that require comprehensive deductive
proficiencies. Furthermore, it turned out that the suggested model suffers much
less from different obstacles that prohibit symbolic reasoning.

A Century Long Commitment to Assessing Artificial Intelligence and its  Impact on Society","Barbara J. Grosz, Peter Stone"," In September 2016, Stanford's ""One Hundred Year Study on Artificial
Intelligence"" project (AI100) issued the first report of its planned long-term
periodic assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on society.
The report, entitled ""Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030,"" examines eight
domains of typical urban settings on which AI is likely to have impact over the
coming years: transportation, home and service robots, healthcare, education,
public safety and security, low-resource communities, employment and workplace,
and entertainment. It aims to provide the general public with a scientifically
and technologically accurate portrayal of the current state of AI and its
potential and to help guide decisions in industry and governments, as well as
to inform research and development in the field. This article by the chair of
the 2016 Study Panel and the inaugural chair of the AI100 Standing Committee
describes the origins of this ambitious longitudinal study, discusses the
framing of the inaugural report, and presents the report's main findings. It
concludes with a brief description of the AI100 project's ongoing efforts and
planned next steps.

Different but Equal: Comparing User Collaboration with Digital Personal  Assistants vs. Teams of Expert Agents","Claudio S. Pinhanez, Heloisa Candello, Mauro C. Pichiliani, Marisa Vasconcelos, Melina Guerra, Maíra G. de Bayser, Paulo Cavalin"," This work compares user collaboration with conversational personal assistants
vs. teams of expert chatbots. Two studies were performed to investigate whether
each approach affects accomplishment of tasks and collaboration costs.
Participants interacted with two equivalent financial advice chatbot systems,
one composed of a single conversational adviser and the other based on a team
of four experts chatbots. Results indicated that users had different forms of
experiences but were equally able to achieve their goals. Contrary to the
expected, there were evidences that in the teamwork situation that users were
more able to predict agent behavior better and did not have an overhead to
maintain common ground, indicating similar collaboration costs. The results
point towards the feasibility of either of the two approaches for user
collaboration with conversational agents.

Under the Hood: Using Diagnostic Classifiers to Investigate and Improve  how Language Models Track Agreement Information","Mario Giulianelli, Jack Harding, Florian Mohnert, Dieuwke Hupkes, Willem Zuidema"," How do neural language models keep track of number agreement between subject
and verb? We show that `diagnostic classifiers', trained to predict number from
the internal states of a language model, provide a detailed understanding of
how, when, and where this information is represented. Moreover, they give us
insight into when and where number information is corrupted in cases where the
language model ends up making agreement errors. To demonstrate the causal role
played by the representations we find, we then use agreement information to
influence the course of the LSTM during the processing of difficult sentences.
Results from such an intervention reveal a large increase in the language
model's accuracy. Together, these results show that diagnostic classifiers give
us an unrivalled detailed look into the representation of linguistic
information in neural models, and demonstrate that this knowledge can be used
to improve their performance.

Approximate Distribution Matching for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning","Wenhu Chen, Guanlin Li, Shujie Liu, Zhirui Zhang, Mu Li, Ming Zhou"," Sequence-to-Sequence models were introduced to tackle many real-life problems
like machine translation, summarization, image captioning, etc. The standard
optimization algorithms are mainly based on example-to-example matching like
maximum likelihood estimation, which is known to suffer from data sparsity
problem. Here we present an alternate view to explain sequence-to-sequence
learning as a distribution matching problem, where each source or target
example is viewed to represent a local latent distribution in the source or
target domain. Then, we interpret sequence-to-sequence learning as learning a
transductive model to transform the source local latent distributions to match
their corresponding target distributions. In our framework, we approximate both
the source and target latent distributions with recurrent neural networks
(augmenter). During training, the parallel augmenters learn to better
approximate the local latent distributions, while the sequence prediction model
learns to minimize the KL-divergence of the transformed source distributions
and the approximated target distributions. This algorithm can alleviate the
data sparsity issues in sequence learning by locally augmenting more unseen
data pairs and increasing the model's robustness. Experiments conducted on
machine translation and image captioning consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed algorithm over the other competing algorithms.
