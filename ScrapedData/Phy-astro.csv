The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS): A Mission to  Understand the Impact of Stars in Exoplanets","David R. Ardila, Evgenya Shkolnik, Paul Scowen, April Jewell, Shouleh Nikzad, Judd Bowman, Michael Fitzgerald, Daniel Jacobs, Constance Spittler, Travis Barman, Sarah Peackock, Matthew Beasley, Varoujan Gorgian, Joe Llama, Victoria Meadows, Mark Swain, Robert Zellem"," The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS) is a NASA-funded
astrophysics mission, devoted to the study of the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain
behavior in low-mass stars. Given their abundance and size, low-mass stars are
important targets in the search for habitable-zone, exoplanets. However, not
enough is known about the stars flare and quiescent emission, which powers
photochemical reactions on the atmospheres of possible planets. Over its
initial 1-year mission, SPARCS will stare at ~10 stars in order to measure
short- (minutes) and long- (months) term variability simultaneously in the
near-UV (NUV - lam = 280 nm) and far-UV (FUV - lam = 162 nm). The SPARCS
payload consists of a 9-cm reflector telescope paired with two high-sensitivity
2D-doped CCDs. The detectors are kept passively cooled at 238K, in order to
reduce dark-current contribution. The filters have been selected to provide
strong rejection of longer wavelengths, where most of the starlight is emitted.
The payload will be integrated within a 6U CubeSat to be placed on a
Sun-synchronous terminator orbit, allowing for long observing stares for all
targets. Launch is expected to occur not earlier than October 2021.

QuasarNET: Human-level spectral classification and redshifting with Deep  Neural Networks","Nicolas Busca, Christophe Balland"," We introduce QuasarNET, a deep convolutional neural network that performs
classification and redshift estimation of astrophysical spectra with
human-expert accuracy. We pose these two tasks as a \emph{feature detection}
problem: presence or absence of spectral features determines the class, and
their wavelength determines the redshift, very much like human-experts proceed.
When ran on BOSS data to identify quasars through their emission lines,
QuasarNET defines a sample $99.51\pm0.03$\% pure and $99.52\pm0.03$\% complete,
well above the requirements of many analyses using these data. QuasarNET
significantly reduces the problem of line-confusion that induces catastrophic
redshift failures to below 0.2\%. We also extend QuasarNET to classify spectra
with broad absorption line (BAL) features, achieving an accuracy of
$98.0\pm0.4$\% for recognizing BAL and $97.0\pm0.2$\% for rejecting non-BAL
quasars. QuasarNET is trained on data of low signal-to-noise and medium
resolution, typical of current and future astrophysical surveys, and could be
easily applied to classify spectra from current and upcoming surveys such as
eBOSS, DESI and 4MOST.

Analytical model of compact star in low-mass X-ray binary with de Sitter  spacetime","Sajahan Molla, Rabiul Islam, Md. Abdul Kayum Jafry, Mehedi Kalam"," In this article, we introduce a de-sitter model in favor of compact stars in
low-mass X-ray binary. Here, we merge the presence of the cosmological constant
on a small scale to discussion the stellar structure and conclude that this
doping is very well suitable with the familiar physical mode of the low-mass
X-ray binary compact stars. We calculate the probable radii, compactness (u)
and surface red-shift (Zs) of six compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries
namely Cyg X-2, V395 Carinae/2S 0921-630, XTE J2123-058, X1822-371 (V691 CrA),
4U 1820-30 and GR Mus (XB 1254-690). We also offer possible equation of state
(EOS) of the stellar object.

MCMC determination of the cosmic UV background at $z\simeq 0$ from  H$α$ fluorescence","Davide Caruso, Francesco Haardt, Michele Fumagalli, Sebastiano Cantalupo"," In a recent paper (Fumagalli et al. 2017) we reported on the detection of a
diffuse H$\alpha$ glow in the outskirts of the nearby, edge-on disc galaxy UGC
7321 observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the ESO Very
Large Telescope. By interpreting the H$\alpha$ emission as fluorescence arising
from hydrogen ionised by an external (i.e., extragalactic) radiation field, we
estimated the UV background (UVB) intensity in terms of HI ionisation rate (per
ion) at $z\simeq 0$ to be in the range $\Gamma_{\rm HI}\sim 6-8\times 10^{-14}$
s$^{-1}$. In the present work, by performing radiative transfer calculations
over a large set of models of the gaseous disc of UGC 7321, we refine our
estimate and through an MCMC analysis derive a value for the photoionisaton
rate of $\Gamma_{\rm HI}=7.27^{+2.93}_{-2.90}\times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$. In
particular, our analysis demonstrates that this value is robust against large
variations in the galaxy model and that the uncertainties are mainly driven by
the errors associated with the observed H$\alpha$ surface brightness. Our
measurement is consistent with several recent determinations of the same
quantity by a completely independent technique (i.e., flux decrement analysis
of the Ly$\alpha$-forest), and support the notion that the low redshift UVB is
largely dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs), possibly with no need of
further contribution from star forming galaxies.

Dust Production and Depletion in Evolved Planetary Systems","J. Farihi, R. van Lieshout, P. W. Cauley, E. Dennihy, K. Y. L. Su, S. J. Kenyon, T. G. Wilson, O. Toloza, B. T. Gänsicke, T. von Hippel, S. Redfield, J. H. Debes, S. Xu, L. Rogers, A. Bonsor, A. Swan, A. F. Pala, W. T. Reach"," The infrared dust emission from the white dwarf GD 56 is found to rise and
fall by 20% peak-to-peak over 11.2 yr, and is consistent with ongoing dust
production and depletion. It is hypothesized that the dust is produced via
collisions associated with an evolving dust disk, temporarily increasing the
emitting surface of warm debris, and is subsequently destroyed or assimilated
within a few years. The variations are consistent with debris that does not
change temperature, indicating that dust is produced and depleted within a
fixed range of orbital radii. Gas produced in collisions may rapidly
re-condense onto grains, or may accrete onto the white dwarf surface on viscous
timescales that are considerably longer than Poynting-Robertson drag for
micron-sized dust. This potential delay in mass accretion rate change is
consistent with multi-epoch spectra of the unchanging Ca II and Mg II
absorption features in GD 56 over 15 yr, although the sampling is sparse.
Overall these results indicate that collisions are likely to be the source of
dust and gas, either inferred or observed, orbiting most or all polluted white
dwarfs.

Extreme Spheres: Counts-in-cells for 21cm intensity mapping","Oliver Leicht, Cora Uhlemann, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Sandrine Codis, Lars Hernquist, Shy Genel"," Intensity mapping surveys will provide access to a coarse view of the cosmic
large-scale structure in unprecedented large volumes at high redshifts. Given
the large fractions of the sky that can be efficiently scanned using emission
from cosmic neutral hydrogen (HI), intensity mapping is ideally suited to probe
a wide range of density environments and hence to constrain cosmology and
fundamental physics. To efficiently extract information from 21cm intensities
beyond average, one needs non-Gaussian statistics that capture large deviations
from mean HI density. Counts-in-cells statistics are ideally suited for this
purpose, as the statistics of matter densities in spheres can be predicted
accurately on scales where their variance is below unity.

A concordance picture of FRB 121102 as a flaring magnetar embedded in a  magnetized ion-electron wind nebula","Ben Margalit, Brian D. Metzger"," The fast radio burst FRB 121102 has repeated multiple times, enabling the
identification of its host galaxy and of a spatially-coincident, compact,
steady (`quiescent') radio synchrotron source. It was proposed that FRB 121102
is powered by a young flaring magnetar, embedded within a decades-old supernova
remnant. Using a time-dependent one-zone model, we show that a single expanding
magnetized electron-ion nebula (powered by the same outbursts likely
responsible for the FRBs) can explain all the basic properties of the quiescent
source (size, flux, self-absorption constraints) and the large but decreasing
rotation measure (RM) of the bursts. The quiescent emission is powered by
relativistic thermal electrons heated at the termination shock of the magnetar
wind, while the RM originates from non-relativistic electrons injected earlier
in the nebula's evolution and cooled through expansion and radiative losses.
The model contains few free parameters, which are tightly constrained by
observations: the total energy injected into the nebula over its history, $\sim
10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg, agrees with the magnetic energy of a millisecond
magnetar; the baryon loading of the magnetar outflow (driven by intermittent
flares) is close to the neutron star escape speed; the predicted source age
$\sim 20-50$ years is consistent with other constraints on the nebula size. For
an energy input rate $\dot{E} \propto t^{-\alpha}$ following the onset of
magnetar activity, we predict secular decay of the RM and quiescent source
flux, which approximately follow ${\rm RM} \propto t^{-(6+\alpha)/2}$ and
$F_{\nu} \propto t^{-(\alpha^2+7\alpha-2)/4}$, respectively.

Origin of CGM OVI in cosmological simulations: redshift, mass and radial  dependence of collisional and photo ionization","S. Roca-Fàbrega, A. Dekel, Y. Faerman, O. Gnat, C. Strawn, D. Ceverino, J. Primack, A. V. Macciò, A. A. Dutton, J. X. Prochaska, J. Stern"," We study the components of cool and warm/hot gas in the circumgalactic medium
(CGM) of simulated galaxies and address the relative production of OVI by
photoionization versus collisional ionization, as a function of halo mass,
redshift, and distance from the galaxy halo center. This is done utilizing two
different suites of zoom-in hydro-cosmological simulations, VELA and NIHAO,
which yield consistent results despite the different codes and different
physical recipes for star formation and feedback. We find that collisional
ionization by thermal electrons dominates at high redshift, while
photoionization of cool or warm gas by the metagalactic radiation takes over
near $z \sim 2$. In halos of $\sim$10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ and above, collisions
become important again at $z<0.5$, while photoionization remains significant
down to $z=0$ for less massive halos. In halos with M > $3 \times 10^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$, most of the photoionized gas at $z \sim 0$ is in the warm phase,
just below the OVI peak ($T \lesssim 3 \times 10^5$ K). We also find that
collisions are dominant in the central regions of halos, while photoionization
is more significant at the outskirts, around ${\rm R_v}$, even in massive
halos. This too may be explained by the presence of warm gas or, in lower mass
halos, by cool gas inflows. The position in redshift of the peak in the
photoionized OVI fraction is dependent on feedback implementation. In the
future, observational estimation of the peak redshift can be used to test
feedback implementation in simulations. The penetration of cool gas into the
warm-hot CGM of high-mass halos also depends on the accretion rate and feedback
strength.

Detecting the Orbital Motion of Nearby Supermassive Black Hole Binaries  with Gaia","Daniel J. D'Orazio, Abraham Loeb"," We show that a 5 year Gaia mission could astrometrically detect the orbital
motion of up to a hundred supermassive black hole binaries with sub-parsec

Magnetic buoyancy in simulated galactic discs with a realistic circum  galactic medium","Ulrich P. Steinwandel, Marcus C. Beck, Alexander Arth, Klaus Dolag, Benjamin P. Moster, Peter Nielaba"," We present simulations of isolated disc galaxies in a realistic environment
performed with the Tree-SPMHD-Code Gadget-3. Our simulations include a
spherical circum-galactic medium (CGM) surrounding the galactic disc, motivated
by observations and the results of cosmological simulations. We present three
galactic models with different halo masses between 10e10 Msol and 10e12 Msol,
and for each we use two different approaches to seed the magnetic field, as
well as a control simulation without a magnetic field. We find that the
amplification of the magnetic field in the centre of the disc leads to a
biconical magnetic outflow of gas that magnetizes the CGM. This biconical
magnetic outflow reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxy by roughly
40 percent compared to the simulations without magnetic fields. As the key
aspect of our simulations, we find that small scale turbulent motion of the gas
in the disc leads to the amplification of the magnetic field up to tens of
10e-6 G, as long as the magnetic field strength is low. For stronger magnetic
fields turbulent motion does not lead to significant amplification but is
replaced by an alpha-omega dynamo. The occurance of a small scale turbulent
dynamo becomes apparent through the magnetic power spectrum and analysis of the
field lines' curvature. In accordance with recent observations we find an
anti-correlation between the spiral structure in the gas density and in the
magnetic field due to a diffusion term added to the induction equation.

Hydrohalite Salt-albedo Feedback Could Cool M-dwarf Planets","Aomawa L. Shields, Regina C. Carns"," A possible surface type that may form in the environments of M-dwarf planets
is sodium chloride dihydrate, or ""hydrohalite"" (NaCl $\cdot$ 2H$_2$O), which
can precipitate in bare sea ice at low temperatures. Unlike salt-free water
ice, hydrohalite is highly reflective in the near-infrared, where M-dwarf stars
emit strongly, making the effect of the interaction between hydrohalite and the
M-dwarf SED necessary to quantify. We carried out the first exploration of the
climatic effect of hydrohalite-induced salt-albedo feedback on extrasolar
planets, using a three-dimensional global climate model. Under fixed CO$_2$
conditions, rapidly-rotating habitable-zone M-dwarf planets receiving 65% or
less of the modern solar constant from their host stars exhibit cooler
temperatures when an albedo parameterization for hydrohalite is included in
climate simulations, compared to simulations without such a parameterization.
Differences in global mean surface temperature with and without this
parameterization increase as the instellation is lowered, which may increase
CO$_2$ build-up requirements for habitable conditions on planets with active
carbon cycles. Synchronously-rotating habitable-zone M-dwarf planets appear
susceptible to salt-albedo feedback at higher levels of instellation (90% or
less of the modern solar constant) than planets with Earth-like rotation
periods, due to their cooler minimum day-side temperatures. These instellation
levels where hydrohalite seems most relevant correspond to several
recently-discovered potentially habitable M-dwarf planets, including Proxima
Centauri b, TRAPPIST-1e, and LHS 1140b, making an albedo parameterization for
hydrohalite of immediate importance in future climate simulations.

The MOSDEF Survey: No Significant Enhancement in Star Formation or  Deficit in Metallicity in Merging Galaxy Pairs at 1.5<=z<=3.5","Timothy J. Wilson, Alice E. Shapley, Ryan L. Sanders, Naveen A.

Fornasini, Gene C. K. Leung, Tom O. Zick"," We study the properties of 32 spectroscopically-identified pairs of galaxies
observed during the peak epoch of star formation in the universe. These systems
are drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey at $1.4 \leq z
\leq 3.8$, and are interpreted as early-stage galaxy mergers. Galaxy pairs in
our sample are identified as two objects whose spectra were collected on the
same Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic slit. Accordingly, all pairs in the sample have
projected separations $R_{{\rm proj}}\leq 60$~kpc. The redshift separation for
pairs was required to be $\Delta z \leq 0.01$ ($\Delta v \lesssim 1000 \mbox{
km s}^{-1}$), but, in practice, all but two pairs have velocity separations
consistent with $\Delta v \leq 500 \mbox{ km s}^{-1}$, which is the standard
threshold for defining interacting galaxy pairs at low redshift. Stellar mass
ratios in our sample range from 1.1 to 550, with 13 ratios closer than 3:1, the
common definition of a ""major merger."" Studies of merging pairs in the local
universe indicate an enhancement in star-formation activity and deficit in
gas-phase oxygen abundance relative to isolated galaxies of the same mass. We
compare the MOSDEF pairs sample to a control sample of isolated galaxies at the
same redshift, finding no measurable SFR enhancement or metallicity deficit at
fixed stellar mass for the pairs sample, in contrast to low-redshift studies.
These results are consistent with some theoretical works suggesting a reduced
differential effect of pre-coalescence mergers on galaxy properties at high
redshift -- specifically that pre-coalescence mergers do not drive strong
starbursts.

Optimal neighbourhood to nurture giants: a fundamental link between star  forming galaxies and direct collapse black holes","Bhaskar Agarwal Fergus Cullen, Sadegh Khochfar, Daniel Ceverino, Ralf S. Klessen"," Massive $10^{4-5}\rm\ M_{\odot}$ black hole seeds resulting from the
\textit{direct} collapse of pristine gas require a metal-free atomic cooling
halo with extremely low H$_2$ fraction, allowing the gas to cool isothermally
in the presence of atomic hydrogen. In order to achieve this
chemo-thermodynamical state, the gas needs to be irradiated by both:
Lyman-Werner (LW) photons in the energy range $11.2-13.6$ eV capable of
photodissociating H$_2$, and $0.76$ eV photons capable of photodetaching H$^-$.
Employing cosmological simulations capable of creating the first galaxies in
high resolution, we explore if there exists a subset that favours DCBH
formation in their vicinity. We find a fundamental relation between the maximum
distance at which a galaxy can cause DCBH formation and its star formation rate
(SFR), which automatically folds in the chemo-thermodynamical effects of both
H$_2$ photo-dissociation and H$^-$ photo-detachment. This is in contrast to the
scatter in the LW flux parameter seen at the maximum distance. It shows up to a
3 order of magnitude scatter, which can be interpreted as a scatter in
`J$_{crit}$'. Thus, computing the rates and/or the LW flux from a galaxy is no
longer necessary to identify neighbouring sites of DCBH formation, as our
relation allows one to distinguish regions where DCBH formation could be
triggered in the vicinity of a galaxy of a given SFR.

1000 CIV absorbers, covering the redshift range 2.55 < z < 4.73, identified in
100 individual sight lines from the XQ-100 Legacy Survey. We detect a
statistical significant NV absorption signal only within 5000 km s$^{-1}$ of
the systemic redshift, z$\rm_{em}$. This absorption trough is $\sim$ 15$\sigma$
when only CIV systems with N(CIV) > 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ are included in the

statistical tool to identify intrinsic systems. We exploit the stacks of 11
different ions to show that the gas in proximity to a quasar exhibits a
considerably different ionization state with respect to gas in the transverse
direction and intervening gas at large velocity separations from the continuum
source. Indeed, we find a dearth of cool gas, as traced by low-ionization
species and in particular by MgII, in the proximity of the quasar. We compare

Retrieval of planetary and stellar properties in transmission  spectroscopy with Aura","Arazi Pinhas, Benjamin V. Rackham, Nikku Madhusudhan, Dániel Apai"," Transmission spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of the atmospheric
properties of transiting exoplanets. To date, studies of exoplanets in transit
have focused on inferring their atmospheric properties such as chemical
compositions, cloud/haze properties, and temperature structures. However,
surface inhomogeneities in the host stars of exoplanets in the form of cool
spots and hot faculae can in principle imprint signatures on the observed
planetary transit spectrum. Here we present Aura, a new retrieval paradigm for
inferring both planetary and stellar properties from a transmission spectrum.
We apply our retrieval framework to a sample of hot giant exoplanets to
determine the significance of stellar heterogeneity and clouds/hazes in their
spectra. The retrieval analyses distinguish four groups of planets. First, the
spectra of WASP-6b and WASP-39b are best characterised by imprints of stellar
heterogeneity and hazes and/or clouds. HD 209458b and HAT-P-12b comprise the
second group for which there is weak evidence for stellar heterogeneity and a
high significance of hazes and/or clouds. The third group constitutes HAT-P-1b
and WASP-31b and shows weak evidence against stellar heterogeneity but weak to
substantial indications of clouds/hazes. The fourth group -- WASP-19b,
WASP-17b, and WASP-12b -- is fit best by molecular and alkali absorbers with
H$_2$ scattering without evidence for stellar heterogeneity and weak to no
evidence for clouds/hazes. Our retrieval methodology paves the way to
simultaneous information on the star and planet from higher resolution spectra

probe of our local Galactic neighborhood. CREs lose energy rapidly via

kiloparsec. Within that distance there are only a few known astrophysical
objects capable of accelerating electrons to such high energies. It is also
possible that the CREs are the products of the annihilation or decay of heavy
dark matter (DM) particles. VERITAS, an array of imaging air Cherenkov

Toward reinforcing the link between Gaia and ICRF frames",Zinovy Malkin," The link problem between radio (VLBI/ICRF) and optical (Gaia/GCRF) celestial
reference frames is analyzed. Both systems should be a realization of the ICRS

Therefore, the link between the ICRF and GCRF should be obtained with similar
accuracy, which is not a trivial task due to relatively large systematic and
random errors in source positions at different frequency bands. In this
presentation, additional possibilities to improve the GCRF-ICRF link accuracy
are discussed. In particular, a possibility to increase the number of ICRF and
GCRF common objects is considered using advanced scheduling of the regular IVS
sessions such as R1 and R4. It is shown that inclusion of supplement
prospective southern sources in these sessions allows enriching southern ICRF
zone without noticeable loss of accuracy of geodetic results. Another topic
discussed in this presentation is using the correlations between radio source
coordinates, which can impact the orientation angles between two frames at a

73 are within the half-mass radius rh. Of the 60 sources inside rh with more
than 5 counts, we estimate that ~38 are background sources. We detected 55 new
sources, and confirmed 29 sources previously detected by ROSAT and/or

are new detections: four active binaries, two blue straggler stars (BSSs), and,
surprisingly, an apparently single cluster member on the main sequence

X-ray luminosity cannot be explained by its currently understood configuration
as a BSS/white-dwarf binary in an eccentric orbit of ~120 days. Its X-ray
detection, combined with reports of short-period optical variability, suggests
the presence of a close binary, which would make this BSS system a hierarchical
multiple. We also classify one source as a new cataclysmic-variable candidate;
it is identified with a known short-period optical variable, whose membership
to NGC188 is unknown. We have compared the X-ray emissivity of NGC188 with
those of other old Galactic open clusters. Our findings confirm the earlier
result that old open clusters have higher X-ray emissivities than other old

Improving Hickson-like compact group finders in redshift surveys: an  implementation in the SDSS","Eugenia Diaz-Gimenez, Ariel Zandivarez, Antonela Taverna"," In this work we present an algorithm to identify compact groups (CGs) that
closely follows Hickson's original aim and that improves the completeness of
the samples of compact groups obtained from redshift surveys. Instead of
identifying CGs in projection first and then checking a velocity concordance
criterion, we identify them directly in redshift space using Hickson-like
criteria. The methodology was tested on a mock lightcone of galaxies built from
the outputs of a recent semi-analytic model of galaxy formation run on top of
the Millennium Simulation I after scaling to represent the first-year Planck
cosmology. The new algorithm identifies nearly twice as many CGs, no longer
missing CGs that failed the isolation criterion because of velocity outliers
lying in the isolation annulus. The new CG sample picks up lower surface
brightness groups, which are both looser and with fainter brightest galaxies,
missed by the classic method. A new catalogue of compact groups from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey is the natural corollary of this study. The publicly
available sample comprises $462$ observational groups with four or more galaxy
members, of which $406$ clearly fulfil all the compact group requirements:
compactness, isolation, and velocity concordance of all of their members. The
remaining $56$ groups need further redshift information of potentially
contaminating sources. This constitutes the largest sample of groups that
strictly satisfy all the Hickson's criteria in a survey with available
spectroscopic information.

Forecasting Gamma-Ray Bursts using Gravitational Waves",Sarp Akcay," We explore the intriguing possibility of employing future ground-based
gravitational-wave interferometers to detect the inspiral of binary neutron
stars sufficiently early to alert electromagnetic observatories so that a
gamma-ray burst (GRB) can be observed in its entirety from its very beginning.
We quantify the ability to predict a GRB by computing the time a binary neutron
star (BNS) system takes to inspiral from its moment of detection to its final
merger. We define the moment of detection to be the instant at which the
interferometer network accumulates a signal-to-noise ratio of 15. For our
computations, we specifically consider BNS systems at luminosity distances of
(i) $D\le200\,$Mpc for the three-interferometer Advanced-LIGO-Virgo network of
2020, and (ii) $D\le 1000\,$Mpc for Einstein Telescope's B and C
configurations. In the case of Advanced LIGO-Virgo we find that we may at best
get a few minutes of warning time, thus we expect no forecast of GRBs in the
2020s. On the other hand, Einstein Telescope will provide us with advance
warning times of more than five hours for $D\le 100$Mpc. Taking one hour as a
benchmark advance warning time, we obtain a corresponding range of roughly 600
Mpc for the Einstein Telescope C configuration. Using current BNS merger event
rates within this volume, we show that Einstein C will forecast
$\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ GRBs in the 2030s. We reapply our warning-time
computation to binary black hole - neutron star inspirals and find 1 to 3 tidal
disruption events to be forecast by the same detector. This is a pedagogical
introduction to gravitational-wave astronomy written at a level accessible to
PhD students, advanced undergraduates, and colleagues in astronomy/astrophysics
who wish to learn more about the underlying physics. Though many of our results
may be known to the experts, they might nonetheless find this article
motivating and exciting.

Optimizing Pulsar Timing Arrays Observations for Detection and  Characterization of Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Sources",M. T. Lam," Observations of low-frequency gravitational waves will require the highest
possible timing precision from an array of the most spin-stable pulsars. We can
improve the sensitivity of a pulsar timing array (PTA) to different
gravitational-wave sources by observing pulsars with low timing noise over
years to decades and distributed across the sky. We discuss observing
strategies for a PTA focused on a stochastic gravitational-wave background such
as from unresolved supermassive black hole binaries as well as focused on
single continuous-wave sources. First we describe the method to calculate a
PTA's sensitivity to different gravitational-wave-source classes. We then apply
our method to the 45 pulsars presented in the North American Nanohertz
Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 11-year data set. For expected
amplitudes of the stochastic background, we find that all pulsars contribute
significantly over the timescale of decades; the exception is for very
pessimistic values of the stochastic background amplitude. For individual
single sources, we find that a number of pulsars contribute to the sensitivity
of a given source but that which pulsars contribute are different depending on
the source, or versus an all-sky metric. Our results seem robust to the
presence of temporally-correlated red noise in pulsar arrival times. It is
critical to obtain more robust pulsar-noise parameters as they heavily affect
our results. Our results show that it is also imperative to locate and time as
many high-precision pulsars as possible, as quickly as possible, to maximize
the sensitivity of next-generation PTA detectors.

ALMA Observations toward the starburst dwarf galaxy NGC 5253: I.  Molecular cloud properties and scaling relations","Rie E. Miura, Daniel Espada, Akihiko Hirota, Kouichiro Nakanishi, George J. Bendo, Hajime Sugai"," We present high-spatial-resolution ($\sim 0\farcs2$, or $\sim$3\,pc) CO(2--1)
observations of the nearest young starburst dwarf galaxy, NGC\,5253, taken with
the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We have identified 118
molecular clouds with average values of 4.3\,pc in radius and 2.2\,\kms\, in
velocity dispersion, which comprise the molecular cloud complexes observed
previously with $\sim$100\,pc resolution. We derive for the first time in this
galaxy the $I{\rm (CO)}$--$N$(H$_2$) conversion factor, $X$ =
$4.1^{+5.9}_{-2.4}\times10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$(K\,\kms)$^{-1}$, based on the
virial method. The line-width and mass-to-size relations of the resolved
molecular clouds present an offset on average toward higher line-widths and
masses with respect to quiescent regions in other nearby spiral galaxies and
our Galaxy. The offset in the scaling relation reaches its maximum in regions
close to the central starburst, where velocity dispersions are $\sim$ 0.5 dex
higher and gas mass surface densities are as high as $\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$ =
10$^3$\,\Msol\,pc $^{-2}$. These central clouds are gravitationally bound
despite the high internal pressure. A spatial comparison with star clusters
found in the literature enables us to identify six clouds that are associated
with young star clusters. Furthermore, the star formation efficiencies (SFEs)
of some of these clouds exceed those found in star-cluster-forming clouds
within our Galaxy. We conclude that once a super star cluster is formed, the
parent molecular clouds are rapidly dispersed by the destructive stellar
feedback, which results in such a high SFE in the central starburst of
NGC\,5253.

Effects of mass models on dynamical mass estimate: the case of ultra  diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2","Kohei Hayashi, Shigeki Inoue"," NGC1052-DF2 was recently discovered as the dark-matter deficient galaxy
claimed by van Dokkum et al. (2018a, vD18). However, large uncertainties on its
dynamical mass estimate have been pointed out, concerning the paucity of
sample, statistical methods and distance measurements. In this work, we discuss
the effects of the difference in modeling of the tracer profile of this galaxy
on the dynamical mass estimate. To do this, we assume that the tracer densities
are modeled with power-law and S\'ersic profiles, and then we solve the
spherical Jeans equation to estimate the dynamical mass. Applying these models
to kinematic data of globular clusters in NGC1052-DF2, we compare 90 per cent
upper limits of dynamical mass-to-light ratios estimated between from this
analysis and from vD18. We find that the upper limit obtained by the power-law
is virtually the same as the result from vD18, whilst this limit estimated by
the S\'ersic is significantly greater than that from vD18, thereby suggesting
that NGC1052-DF2 can still be a dark-matter dominated system. Consequently, we
propose that dynamical mass estimate of a galaxy is largely affected by not
only small kinematic sample but the choice of tracer distributions, and thus
the estimated mass still remains quite uncertain.

Protonated CO2 in massive star-forming clumps","F. Fontani, A. Vagnoli, M. Padovani, L. Colzi, P. Caselli, V.M. Rivilla"," Interstellar CO2 is an important reservoir of carbon and oxygen, and one of
the major constituents of the icy mantles of dust grains, but it is not
observable directly in the cold gas because has no permanent dipole moment. Its
protonated form, HOCO+, is believed to be a good proxy for gaseous CO2.
However, it has been detected in only a few star-forming regions so far, so
that its interstellar chemistry is not well understood. We present new
detections of HOCO+ lines in 11 high-mass star-forming clumps. Our observations
increase by more than three times the number of detections in star-forming
regions so far. We have derived beam-averaged abundances relative to H2 in
between 0.3 and 3.8 x 10^{-11}. We have compared these values with the
abundances of H13CO+, a possible gas-phase precursor of HOCO+, and CH3OH, a
product of surface chemistry. We have found a positive correlation with H13CO+,
while with CH3OH there is no correlation. We suggest that the gas-phase
formation route starting from HCO+ plays an important role in the formation of
HOCO+, perhaps more relevant than protonation of CO2 (upon evaporation of this
latter from icy dust mantles).

H2 chemistry in galaxy simulations: an improved supernova feedback model",Alessandro Lupi," In this study, we present a new, physically motivated sub-grid prescription
for supernova feedback, which accounts for the unresolved energy-conserving
phase of the bubble expansion. We implement this model in the mesh-less
hydrodynamic code GIZMO, coupled with the chemistry library krome, and we
validate it against different setups, to address how it affects the
formation/dissociation of molecular hydrogen (H2). First, we test the model in
very idealised conditions, to show that it can accurately reproduce the
terminal momentum of the blast-wave independent of resolution. Then, we apply
it to a suite of numerical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy and
compare it with a similar run employing the delayed-cooling sub-grid
prescription. We find that the delayed-cooling model, by pressurising ad-hoc
the gas, is more effective in suppressing star formation. However, to get this
effect, it must maintain the gas warm/hot at densities where it is expected to
cool efficiently, artificially changing the thermo-chemical state of the gas,
and reducing the H2 abundance even in dense gas. Mechanical feedback, on the
other hand, is able to reproduce observed correlations like the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and the H2 column densities without altering the gas
thermodynamics, and, at the same time, can drive more powerful outflows.
Finally, we show that the model is consistent at different resolution levels,
with only mild differences.

Structure Formation in a Young Protoplanetary Disk by a Magnetic Disk  Wind","Sanemichi Z. Takahashi, Takayuki Muto"," Structure formation in young protoplanetary disks is investigated using a
one-dimensional model including the formation and the evolution of disks.
Recent observations with ALMA found that a ring-hole structure may be formed in
young protoplanetary disks, even when the disk is embedded in the envelope. We
present a one-dimensional model for the formation of a protoplanetary disk from
a molecular cloud core and its subsequent long-term evolution within a single
framework. Such long-term evolution has not been explored by numerical
simulations due to the limitation of computational power. In our model, we
calculate the time evolution of the surface density of the gas and the dust
with the wind mass loss and the radial drift of the dust in the disk. We find
that the MHD disk wind is a viable mechanism for the formation of ring-hole
structure in young disks. We perform a parameter study of our model and derive
condition of the formation of ring-hole structures within $6\times10^5$ years
after the start of the collapse of the molecular cloud core. The final outcome
of the disk shows five types of morphology and this can be understood by
comparing the timescale of the viscous diffusion, the mass loss by MHD disk
wind and the radial drift of the dust. We discuss the implication of the model
for the WL 17 system, which is suspected to be an embedded, yet transitional,

Tracking the dynamics of skyglow with differential photometry using a  digital camera with fisheye lens","Andreas Jechow, Salvador J. Ribas, Ramon Canal-Domingo, Franz Hölker, Zoltán Kolláth, Christopher C. M. Kyba"," Artificial skyglow is dynamic due to changing atmospheric conditions and the

Diffuse interstellar bands in the HII region M17: Insights into their  relation with the total-to-selective visual extinction $R_V$","M.C. Ramírez-Tannus, N.L.J. Cox, L. Kaper, A. de Koter"," Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are broad absorption features measured in
sightlines probing the diffuse interstellar medium. Although large
carbon-bearing molecules have been proposed as the carriers producing DIBs,
their identity remains unknown. The sight line to the young massive
star-forming region M17 shows anomalous extinction in the sense that the
total-to-selective extinction parameter differs significantly from the average
Galactic value and may reach values $R_{V} > 4$. Given the high $R_V$ values,
we investigate whether the DIBs in sight lines towards young OB stars in M17
show a peculiar behaviour. We measure the properties of the most prominent DIBs
in M17 and study these as a function of $E(B-V)$ and $R_{V}$. The DIB strengths
in M17 concur with the observed relations between DIB equivalent width and
reddening $E(B-V)$ in Galactic sight lines. For several DIBs we discover a
linear relation between the normalised DIB strength EW/$A_{V}$ and
$R_{V}^{-1}$. These trends suggest two groups: (i) a group of ten moderately
strong DIBs that show a sensitivity to changes in $R_{V}$ that is modest and
proportional to DIB strength, and (ii) a group of four very strong DIBs that
react sensitively and to a similar degree to changes in $R_{V}$, but in a way
that does not appear to depend on DIB strength. The DIB behaviour as a function
of reddening is not peculiar in sight lines to M17. Also, we do not detect
anomalous DIB profiles as seen in Her 36. DIBs are stronger, per unit visual
extinction, in sight lines characterised by a smaller value of $R_{V}$ (large
fraction of small dust particles). New relations between extinction normalised
DIB strengths, EW/$A_V$, and $R_V$ support the idea that DIB carriers and
interstellar dust are connected. Given the distinct behaviour of two groups of
DIBs, different types of carriers do not necessarily relate to the dust grains
in a similar way.

experiments are mandatory but they are still rare. Beyond the initial process
of hit-and-stick collisions, some additional selective processing might be
needed to explain Mercury. In analogy to icy worlds, such planets might, e.g.,
form in environments which are enriched in iron. This requires methods to
separate iron and silicate at early stages. Photophoresis might be one viable
way. Mercury and Mercury-like planets might also form due to the ferromagnetic

(log M*/Msun ~ 10.0 - 10.9) and star formation rates (~ 35 - 115 Msun/yr).
Given the strong and well understood evolution of the interstellar medium from
the present to z = 2, we investigate the behaviour of the [C II] emission and
empirically identify its primary driver. We detect [C II] from six galaxies
(four secure, two tentative) and estimate ensemble averages including non
detections. The [C II]-to-infrared luminosity ratio (L[C II]/LIR) of our sample
is similar to that of local main-sequence galaxies (~ 2 x 10^-3), and ~ 10
times higher than that of starbursts. The [C II] emission has an average
spatial extent of 4 - 7 kpc, consistent with the optical size. Complementing
our sample with literature data, we find that the [C II] luminosity correlates
with galaxies' molecular gas mass, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.2 dex
and without evident systematics: the [C II]-to-H2 conversion factor (alpha_[C
II] ~ 30 Msun/Lsun) is largely independent of galaxies' depletion time,
metallicity, and redshift. [C II] seems therefore a convenient tracer to
estimate galaxies' molecular gas content regardless of their starburst or
main-sequence nature, and extending to metal-poor galaxies at low and high
redshifts. The dearth of [C II] emission reported for z > 6 - 7 galaxies might
suggest either a high star formation efficiency or a small fraction of UV light
from star formation reprocessed by dust.

Mapping the Conditions for Hydrodynamic Instability on Viscous Models of  Protoplanetary Disks","Thomas Pfeil, Hubert Klahr"," Several hydrodynamical instabilities potentially operating in disks around
young stars have been discussed lately that all depend on the thermodynamic
stratification of the disk and on the local rate of thermal relaxation. In this
paper, we map constraints on the spatial extents of hydrodynamically unstable
regions for the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI), the Convective OverStability
(COS), and the amplification of vortices via the Subcritical Baroclinic
Instability (SBI) onto 1+1 dimensional, steady state accretion disk models.
These models include the effects of stellar irradiation, viscous heating and
flux-limited radiative transfer and allow for a self-consistent determination
of the local radial and vertical stratification and thermal relaxation rate, in
dependence of the chosen parameters. Our results imply that passive disks with
$\alpha\lesssim 10^{-4}$ do only have VSI and COS susceptible zones at radii
$\gtrsim 10\, \text{au}$ and about one pressure scale height above the
midplane. SBI nonetheless operates even for this low $\alpha$ between $\sim 0.3
\, \text{au}$ and $\sim 50\, \text{au}$. For $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-4}$, VSI and
COS become active down to radii of $\sim 1\, \mathrm{au}$. Here, despite
relatively long cooling times, VSI can operate even close to the midplane, due
to the vertically adiabatic structure of the viscously heated disk. The growth
of all considered instabilities is favored for lower stellar masses, larger
disk masses and larger $\alpha$-values. We conclude that if any mechanism is
able to create at least low $\alpha$-stresses ($\sim 10^{-4}$) that lead to
viscous heating of the disk, hydrodynamical instabilities are likely to operate
in significant parts of the planet forming zones in disks around young stars.
Thus these instabilities are possible candidates to explain the rings and
vortices observed with ALMA and VLT.

Optimal constraints on primordial gravitational waves from the lensed  CMB",Julien Carron," We demonstrate how to obtain optimal constraints on a primordial
gravitational wave component in lensed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data
under ideal conditions. We first derive an estimator of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, $r$, by using an error-controlled close approximation to the exact
posterior, under the assumption of Gaussian primordial CMB and lensing
deflection potential. This combines fast internal iterative lensing
reconstruction with optimal recovery of the unlensed CMB. We evaluate its
performance on simulated low-noise polarization data targeted at the
recombination peak. We carefully demonstrate our $r$-posterior estimate is
unbiased and optimal, making it the most powerful estimator of primordial
gravitational waves from the CMB. We compare these constraints to those
obtained from $B$-mode band-power likelihood analyses on the same simulated
data, before and after map-level quadratic estimator delensing, and iterative
delensing. Internally, iteratively delensed band powers are only slightly less
powerful on average (by less than 10\%), promising close-to-optimal constraints
from a stage IV CMB experiment.

J. van der Horst, R. J. van Weeren"," The shape of low-frequency radio continuum spectra of normal galaxies is not
well understood, the key question being the role of physical processes such as
thermal absorption in shaping them. In this work we take advantage of the LOFAR
Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) to investigate such spectra for a
large sample of nearby star-forming galaxies. Using the measured 150MHz flux
densities from the LOFAR MSSS survey and literature flux densities at various
frequencies we have obtained integrated radio spectra for 106 galaxies. The
spectra are explained through the use of a three-dimensional model of galaxy
radio emission, and radiation transfer dependent on the galaxy viewing angle
and absorption processes. Spectra of our galaxies are generally flatter at
lower compared to higher frequencies but as there is no tendency for the highly
inclined galaxies to have more flattened low-frequency spectra, we argue that
the observed flattening is not due to thermal absorption, contradicting the
suggestion of Israel & Mahoney (1990). According to our modelled radio maps for
M51-like galaxies, the free-free absorption effects can be seen only below
30MHz and in the global spectra just below 20MHz, while in the spectra of
starburst galaxies, like M82, the flattening due to absorption is instead
visible up to higher frequencies of about 150MHz. Locally, within galactic
disks, the absorption effects are distinctly visible in M51-like galaxies as
spectral flattening around 100-200MHz in the face-on objects, and as turnovers
in the edge-on ones, while in M82-like galaxies there are strong turnovers at
frequencies above 700MHz, regardless of viewing angle. Our modelling suggests
that the weak spectral flattening observed in the nearby galaxies studied here
results principally from synchrotron spectral curvature due to cosmic ray
energy losses and propagation effects.

The Kinematics of Cluster Galaxies via Velocity Dispersion Profiles","Lawrence E. Bilton, Kevin A. Pimbblet"," We present an analysis of the kinematics of a sample of 14 galaxy clusters
via velocity dispersion profiles (VDPs), compiled using cluster parameters
defined within the X-Ray Galaxy Clusters Database (BAX) cross-matched with data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We determine the presence of
substructure in the clusters from the sample as a proxy for recent core
mergers, resulting in 4 merging and 10 non-merging clusters to allow for
comparison between their respective dynamical states. We create VDPs for our
samples and divide them by mass, colour and morphology to assess how their
kinematics respond to the environment. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio our
galaxy clusters are normalised and co-added to a projected cluster radius at
$0.0 - 2.5$ $r_{200}$. We find merging cluster environments possess an
abundance of a kinematically-active (rising VDP) mix of red and blue elliptical
galaxies, which is indicative of infalling substructures responsible for
pre-processing galaxies. Comparatively, in non-merging cluster environments
galaxies generally decline in kinematic activity as a function of increasing
radius, with bluer galaxies possessing the highest velocities, likely as a
result of fast infalling field galaxies. However, the variance in kinematic
activity between blue and red cluster galaxies across merging and non-merging
cluster environments suggests galaxies exhibit differing modes of galaxy
accretion onto a cluster potential as a function of the presence of a core
merger.

Why do many early-type galaxies lack emission lines? I. Fossil clues","F. Herpich, G. Stasińska, A. Mateus, N. Vale Asari, R. Cid Fernandes"," Early-type retired galaxies (RGs, i.e. galaxies which no longer form stars)
can be divided into two classes: those with no emission lines, here dubbed
lineless RGs, and those with emission lines, dubbed liny RGs. Both types of
galaxies contain hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) which emit ionizing
photons. The difference must thus lie in the presence or absence of a reservoir
of ionizable gas. From a volume-limited sample of 38\,038 elliptical galaxies,
we explore differences in physical properties between liny and lineless using
data from the SDSS, WISE and GALEX catalogues. To avoid biases in the
comparison, we pair-match liny and lineless in stellar-mass, redshift and
half-light Petrosian radius. We detect marginal differences in their optical
stellar ages and NUV luminosities, indicating that liny RGs have an excess of
intermediate-age (0.1--5 Gyr) stellar populations. Liny RGs show higher dust
attenuation and $W3$ luminosities than their lineless counterparts. We also
find that the amount of warm gas needed to explain the observed \Ha luminosity
in liny RGs is $10^5$--$10^8$\msun, and that their \nii/\oii emission-line
ratios are typical of those of the most massive star-forming galaxies. Taken
together, these results rules out the following sources for the warm gas in
liny RGs: mass-loss from intermediate-mass stars, mergers with metal-poor
galaxies and intergalactic streams. They imply instead an inflow of enriched
gas previously expelled from the galaxy or a merger with a metal-rich galaxy.
The ionization source and the origin of the gas producing the emission lines
are thus disconnected.

Class 0 protostars and just 11% of Class I protostars have candidate disks,
while 78% of Class 0 and I protostars do not have signs of disks within our 12
AU disk diameter resolution limit, indicating that at 8 mm most disks in the
Class 0 and I phases are <10 AU in radius. These small radii may be a result of
surface brightness sensitivity limits. Modeled 8 mm radii are similar to the
radii of known Class 0 disks with detected Keplerian rotation. Since our 8 mm
data trace a population of larger dust grains which radially drift towards the
protostar and are lower limits on true disk sizes, large disks at early times
do not seem to be particularly rare. We find statistical evidence that Class 0
and I disks are likely drawn from the same distribution, meaning disk
properties may be defined early in the Class 0 phase and do not undergo large
changes through the Class I phase. By combining our candidate disk properties
with previous polarization observations, we find a qualitative indication that
misalignment between inferred envelope-scale magnetic fields and outflows may
indicate disks on smaller scales in Class 0 sources.

The non-modal onset of the tearing instability",David MacTaggart," We investigate the onset of the classical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) tearing
instability (TI) and focus on non-modal (transient) growth rather than the
tearing mode. With the help of pseudospectral theory, the operators of the
linear equations are shown to be highly non-normal, resulting in the
possibility of significant transient growth at the onset of the TI. This
possibility increases as the Lundquist number $S$ increases. In particular, we
find evidence, numerically, that the maximum possible transient growth,
measured in the $L_2$-norm, for the classical setup of current sheets unstable
to the TI, scales as $O(S^{1/4})$ on time scales of $O(S^{1/4})$ for $S\gg 1$.
This behaviour is much faster than the time scale $O(S^{1/2})$ when the
solution behaviour is dominated by the tearing mode. The size of transient
growth obtained is dependent on the form of the initial perturbation. Optimal
initial conditions for the maximum possible transient growth are determined,
which take the form of wave packets and can be thought of as noise concentrated
at the current sheet. We also examine how the structure of the eigenvalue
spectrum relates to physical quantities.

the total particle density always has a finite value. Therefore, the Bogolyubov
transformations are well-defined and the Hilbert spaces spanned by the vacuum

large values of $k$ are produced only in the future. The negative pressure
resulting from the gravitational particle creation is also determined. It is
then argued that this pressure even in the presence of energy density and

Gravitational smoothing of kinks on cosmic string loops","Jeremy M. Wachter, Ken D. Olum"," We analyze the effect of gravitational back reaction on cosmic string loops

Kinks are not rounded off, but may be straightened out. This means that back
reaction will only cause loops with kinks to develop cusps after some

present results from each. There is general agreement amongst all results that
we find an H2O absorption feature with 3.5-4.0 sigma significance. However, the
feature is muted in comparison to a clear atmosphere at solar composition.
Although the detection of the water feature is robust, the reasons for the
muting of this feature are ambiguous due to a degeneracy between clouds and
composition. The data does not yield robust detections of any molecular species
other than H2O. The group was motivated to perform an additional set of
retrieval exercises to investigate an apparent bump in the spectrum at ~ 1.55
um. We explore possible disequilibrium chemistry and find this feature is
consistent with super-solar HCN abundance but it is questionable if the
required mixing ratio of HCN is chemically and physically plausible. The
ultimate goal of this study is to vet WASP-63b as a potential community target

Photo-polarimetric characteristics of brown dwarfs, Part I: uniform  cloud decks","Suniti Sanghavi, Avi Shporer"," This work is a theoretical exploration for facilitating the interpretation of
polarimetric observations in terms of cloudiness, rotational velocities and
effective temperatures of brown dwarfs (BDs). An envelope of scatterers like
free-electrons, atoms/molecules, or haze/clouds affects the Stokes-vector of
radiation emitted by oblate bodies. Due to high rotation rates, BDs can be
considerably oblate. We present a conics-based radiative transfer (RT) scheme
for computing the disc-resolved and disc-integrated polarized emission of an
oblate BD or extrasolar giant planet (EGP) bearing homogenous or patchy clouds.
Assuming a uniform grey atmosphere, we theoretically examine the
photopolarimetric sensitivity to its scattering properties like cloud optical
thickness and grain-size, concurrently with BD properties, like oblateness,
inclination and effective temperature, which are all treated as free
parameters. Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational
darkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated
polarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the
resulting polarization.

Foreground effect on the $J$-factor estimation of ultra-faint dwarf  spheroidal galaxies","Koji Ichikawa, Shun-ichi Horigome, Miho N. Ishigaki, Shigeki Matsumoto, Masahiro Ibe, Hajime Sugai, Kohei Hayashi"," Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are promising targets for the gamma-ray
dark matter (DM) search. In particular, DM annihilation signal is expected to
be strong in some of the recently discovered nearby ultra-faint dSphs, which
potentially give stringent constraints on the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV WIMP DM.
However, various non-negligible systematic uncertainties complicate the
estimation of the astrophysical factors relevant for the DM search in these
objects. Among them, the effects of foreground stars particularly attract
attention because the contamination is unavoidable even for the future
kinematical survey. In this article, we assess the effects of the foreground
contamination on the astrophysical $J$-factor estimation by generating mock
samples of stars in the four ultra-faint dSphs and using a model of future
spectrographs. We investigate various data cuts to optimize the quality of the
data and apply a likelihood analysis which takes member and foreground stellar
distributions into account. We show that the foreground star contaminations in
the signal region (the region of interest) and their statistical uncertainty
can be estimated by interpolating the foreground star distribution in the
control region where the foreground stars dominate the member stars. Such
regions can be secured at future spectroscopic observations utilizing a
multiple object spectrograph with a large field of view; e.g. the Prime Focus
Spectrograph mounted on Subaru Telescope. The above estimation has several
advantages: The data-driven estimation of the contamination makes the analysis
of the astrophysical factor stable against the complicated foreground
distribution. Besides, foreground contamination effect is considered in the
likelihood analysis.

Distinguishing black holes and naked singularities with iron line  spectroscopy","Honghui Liu, Menglei Zhou, Cosimo Bambi"," It is commonly thought that the final product of gravitational collapse is a
black hole. Nevertheless, theoretical studies have not yet provided a final
answer to the question whether black holes are the only possible outcome or
whether naked singularities are also allowed. Observational tests may thus
represent a complementary approach. In the present paper, we consider the
Janis-Newman-Winicour metric, which describes a rotating source with a
surface-like naked singularity. We calculate iron line shapes in the reflection
spectrum of a putative disk around a Janis-Newman-Winicour singularity and we
compare our results with the iron line shapes expected in the spectrum of a
Kerr black hole. While it is difficult to distinguish the two spacetimes from
the iron line shape in general, it seems that Janis-Newman-Winicour
singularities cannot mimic fast-rotating Kerr black holes observed at a low or
moderate inclination angle. Our analysis thus suggests that available
observations of specific sources can already constrain the possible existence
of Janis-Newman-Winicour singularities in the Universe.

The Near-Infrared Transmission Spectra of TRAPPIST-1 Planets b, c, d, e,  f, and g and Stellar Contamination in Multi-Epoch Transit Spectra","Zhanbo Zhang, Yifan Zhou, Benjamin V. Rackham, Daniel Apai"," The seven approximately Earth-sized transiting planets in the
\object{TRAPPIST-1} system provide a unique opportunity to explore habitable
zone and non-habitable zone small planets within the same system. Its habitable
zone exoplanets -- due to their favorable transit depths -- are also worlds for
which atmospheric transmission spectroscopy is within reach with the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) and with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We
present here an independent reduction and analysis of two \textit{HST} Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-infrared transit spectroscopy datasets for six
planets (b through g). Utilizing our physically-motivated detector charge trap
correction and a custom cosmic ray correction routine, we confirm the general
shape of the transmission spectra presented by \textbf{\citet{deWit2016,
deWit2018}}. Our data reduction approach leads to a 25\% increase in the usable
data and reduces the risk of confusing astrophysical brightness variations
(e.g., flares) with instrumental systematics. No prominent absorption features
are detected in any individual planet's transmission spectra; by contrast, the
combined spectrum of the planets shows a suggestive decrease around
1.4\,$\micron$ similar to an inverted water absorption feature. Including
transit depths from \textit{K2}, the SPECULOOS-South Observatory, and
\textit{Spitzer}, we find that the complete transmission spectrum is fully
consistent with stellar contamination owing to the transit light source effect.
These spectra demonstrate how stellar contamination can overwhelm planetary
absorption features in low-resolution exoplanet transit spectra obtained by
\textit{HST} and \textit{JWST} and also highlight the challenges in combining
multi epoch observations for planets around rapidly rotating spotted stars.

Obscured star-formation in bright z ~ 7 Lyman-break galaxies","R.A.A.Bowler, N.Bourne, J.S.Dunlop, R.J.McLure, D.J.McLeod"," We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of the

emission), while the others remain individually undetected at the $3\sigma$

\simeq 2 \times 10^{11}\,{\rm L}_{\odot}$, corresponding to an obscured
star-formation rate (SFR) that is comparable to that inferred from the
unobscured UV emission. In comparison to the infrared excess (IRX$\,=L_{\rm
FIR}/L_{\rm UV}$)-$\beta$ relation, our results are consistent with a
Calzetti-like attenuation law (assuming a dust temperature of T = 40-50 K). We
find a physical offset of 3 kpc between the dust continuum emission and the
rest-frame UV light probed by Hubble Space Telescope imaging for galaxy ID65666

dust distribution, where 75% of the total star formation activity (SFR$

Our results provide direct evidence that dust obscuration plays a key role in
shaping the bright-end of the observed rest-frame UV luminosity function at $z

existence of a heavily-obscured component of galaxy ID65666 indicates that
dusty star-forming regions, or even entire galaxies, that are ""UV-dark"" are

A Physical Model for the Spectral-Timing Properties of Accreting Black  Holes","Ra'ad D. Mahmoud, Chris Done"," We develop new techniques to deconvolve the radial structure of the X-ray
emission region in the bright low/hard state of the black hole Cygnus X-1 using
both spectral and timing data in the 3-35~keV range. The spectrum at these
energies is dominated by Comptonisation rather than the disc, but there is a
complex pattern in the time lags between different energy bands and differences
in the normalisation and shape in the power spectra of these bands, which
clearly shows that the Comptonisation is not produced from a single,
homogeneous region. We use a physically based model of density fluctuations
propagating through a spectrally inhomogeneous flow, setting the spectral
components by jointly fitting to the time-averaged and Fourier resolved
spectra. The predicted variability in any band is modelled analytically in
Fourier space so it can be fit directly to the observed power spectra and lags.
We find that the best fit model picks out three distinct radii in the flow,
each with a distinct Compton spectrum. The variability and luminosity produced
at these radii is enhanced, while propagation of fluctuations from larger radii
is suppressed. We associate these radii with the disc truncation, the inner
edge of the flow, and (more speculatively) the jet launch radius. These
distinct radii are most evident where the source is close to a transition
between the low/hard and high/soft states. We suggest that the smoother power
spectra seen at lower luminosities imply that the source structure is simpler
away from the transition.

Magnetic field at a jet base: extreme Faraday rotation in 3C 273  revealed by ALMA","T. Hovatta, S. O'Sullivan, I. Martí-Vidal, T. Savolainen, A. Tchekhovskoy"," We have studied the polarization behavior of the quasar 3C 273 over the 1 mm
wavelength band at ALMA with a total bandwidth of 7.5 GHz across 223 to 243 GHz
at 0.8"" resolution, corresponding to 2.1 kpc at the distance of 3C 273. With
these observations we are able to probe the optically thin polarized emission
close to the jet base, and constrain the magnetic field structure at the jet
launching region. We compute the Faraday rotation measure using simple linear
fitting and Faraday rotation measure synthesis. In addition, we model the
broadband behavior of the fractional Stokes Q and U parameters. The systematic
uncertainties in the polarization observations at ALMA are assessed through
Monte Carlo simulations. We find the unresolved core of 3C 273 to be 3.3%
linearly polarized. We detect a very high rotation measure (RM) of ~
3.6x10$^5$rad/m$^2$ over the 1 mm band with all the methods we have used. This
results in a rotation of >30 degrees of the intrinsic electric vector position
angle, which is significantly higher than typically assumed for millimeter
wavelengths. Our results strongly favor depolarization models over an external
Faraday screen without depolarization. For a single region dominating the
polarized emission, the RM and depolarization we observe can be explained by
external Faraday dispersion or an ordered RM gradient within the synthesized
beam. Further multifrequency and high angular resolution observations are
needed to determine the location and structure of the magnetic field of the
Faraday active region. Comparing our RM estimate with values obtained at lower
frequencies, the RM increases as a function of observing frequency, following a
power law with an index of ~1.9 consistent with a sheath surrounding a
conically expanding jet. We also detect ~0.2% circular polarization, although
further observations are needed to confirm this result. (Abridged.)

interacting dark energy (IDE) models, featuring interactions between dark
matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). In the first part of our work, we start by
considering two IDE models which are known to present early-time linear
perturbation instabilities. Applying a transformation depending on the dark
energy equation of state (EoS) to the DM-DE coupling, we then obtain two novel
stable IDE models. Subsequently, we derive robust and accurate constraints on
the parameters of these models, assuming a constant EoS $w_x$ for the DE fluid,
in light of some of the most recent publicly available cosmological data. These
include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization
anisotropy measurements from the \textit{Planck} satellite, a selection of
Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, Supernovae Type-Ia luminosity
distance measurements from the JLA sample, and measurements of the Hubble
parameter up to redshift $2$ from cosmic chronometers. Our analysis displays a
mild preference for the DE fluid residing in the phantom region ($w_x<-1$),
with significance up to 95\% confidence level, while we obtain new upper limits
on the coupling parameter between the dark components. The preference for a
phantom DE suggests a coupling function $Q<0$, thus a scenario where energy
flows from the DE to the DM. We also examine the possibility of addressing the
$H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions, finding that only the former can be partially
alleviated. Finally, we perform a Bayesian model comparison analysis to
quantify the possible preference for the two IDE models against the standard
concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, finding that the latter is always preferred

the dust ridge. We identify 6 ""clumps"" related to the well known OMC-1 to 5 and
11 ""sub-clumps"" within the map and they are separated not randomly but in
roughly equal intervals along the ISF. The average spacing of clumps is
11.30'$\pm$1.31' (1.36$\pm$0.16 pc ) and the average spacing of sub-clumps is
7.18'$\pm$1.19' (0.86$\pm$0.14 pc). These spacings agree well with the
predicted values of the thermal (0.86 pc) and turbulent sausage instability
(1.43 pc) by adopting a cylindric geometry of the ISF with an inclination of
$60^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight. We also find a velocity
gradient of about 0.6 km s-1 pc-1 that runs along the ISF which likely arises
from an overall rotation of the Orion A molecular cloud. The inferred ratio
between rotational and gravitational energy is well below unity. Furthermore,
fluctuations are seen in the centroid velocity diagram along the ISF. The OMC-1

rotation in the tangential component of proper motions for 11 out of 51

the degree of internal rotation and relaxation time, highlighting the
importance of long-term dynamical evolution in shaping the clusters current

a fundamental role in the earliest phases of cluster formation. Finally,

Irreducible finite energy resolution effects motivate refining the prediction

Diverse protoplanetary disk morphology produced by a Jupiter-mass planet","Jaehan Bae, Paola Pinilla, Tilman Birnstiel"," Combining hydrodynamic planet-disk interaction simulations with dust
evolution models, we show that protoplanetary disks having a giant planet can
reveal diverse morphology in (sub-)millimeter continuum, including a full disk
without significant radial structure, a transition disk with an inner cavity, a
disk with a single gap and a central continuum peak, and a disk with multiple
rings and gaps. Such a diversity originates from (1) the level of viscous
transport in the disk which determines the number of gaps a planet can open;
(2) the size and spatial distributions of grains determined by the coagulation,
fragmentation, and radial drift, which in turn affects the emmisivity of the
disk at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths; and (3) the angular resolution used to
observe the disk. In particular, our results show that disks having the same
underlying gas distribution can have very different grain size/spatial
distributions and thus appearance in continuum, depending on the interplay
among coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift. This suggests that proper
treatments for the grain growth have to be included in models of protoplanetary
disks concerning continuum properties and that complementary molecular line
observations are highly desired in addition to continuum observations to reveal
the true nature of disks. The fact that a single planet can produce diverse
disk morphology emphasizes the need to search for more direct, localized
