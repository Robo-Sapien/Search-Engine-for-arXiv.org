Rainbow gravity corrections to the information flux of a black hole","Zhong-Wen Feng, Shu-Zheng Yang"," In this paper, by utilizing the rainbow functions that were proposed by
Amelino-Camelia \emph{et al}., the information flux of rainbow Schwarzschild
black hole and its sparsity are investigated. To begin with, we calculate the
rainbow gravity corrections to the Hawking temperature and entropy. According
to these modifications, the information flux and the sparsity of Hawking
radiation in rainbow gravity are explored. The results show that the rainbow
gravity has a very significant effect on the information flux. When the mass of
rainbow Schwarzschild black hole approaches to the order of Planck scale, the
Bekenstein entropy loss per emitted quanta in terms of the mass reduces to
zero. Furthermore, we also find that the sparsity of Hawking radiation is no
longer a constant, instead, it monotonically decreases as the mass of black
hole decrease. At the final stages of evaporation, the rainbow sparsity of
Hawking radiation becomes infinity, which indicates the effect quantum gravity
stops the radiation and leads to remnant.

A Class of Higher-Dimensional Solutions of Einstein's Vacuum Equation","Carlos Batista, Gabriel Luz Almeida"," A new class of higher-dimensional exact solutions of Einstein's vacuum
equation is presented. These metrics are written in terms of the exponential of
a symmetric matrix and when this matrix is diagonal the solution reduces to
higher-dimensional generalizations of Kasner spacetime with a cosmological
constant. On the other hand, the metrics attained when such matrix is
non-diagonal have more intricate algebraic structures. Such solutions have not
been presented in the literature yet.

Exact black-hole formation with a conformally coupled scalar field in  three dimensions","Luis Avilés, Hideki Maeda, Cristian Martinez"," We present exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions in three-dimensional
AdS gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field. They contain stealth
configurations of the scalar field overflying the BTZ spacetime and also
solutions with a non-vanishing energy-momentum tensor. The latter non-stealth
class consists of the solution obtained by Xu and its analytic extension. It is
shown that this proper extension represents: (i) an eternally shrinking
dynamical black hole, (ii) a curious spacetime which admits an event horizon
without any trapped surface, or (iii) gravitational collapse of a scalar field
in an asymptotically AdS spacetime. In the last case, by attaching the solution
regularly to the past massless BTZ spacetime with a vanishing scalar field, the
whole spacetime represents the black-hole formation from regular initial data
in an asymptotically AdS spacetime. Depending on the parameters, the formed
black hole can be asymptotically static in far future.

Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling Wave Function","J. Kristiano, R. D. Lambaga, H. S. Ramadhan"," We revisit the famous Coleman-de Luccia formalism for decay of false vacuum
in gravitational theory. Since the corresponding wave function is
time-independent we argue that its instanton's interpretation as the decay rate
probability is problematic. We instead propose that such phenomenon can better
be described by the Wheeler-de Witt's wave function. To do so, the
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism is employed in the WKB approximation. The scalar and
gravitational fields can then be treated as a two-dimensional effective metric.
For a particular case of dS-to-dS tunneling, we calculated the wave function
and found that it depends only on the potential of the false, and not on the
true, vacuum; reminiscent of, though in totally different formalism with, the
Hawking-Moss result. In general, this alternative approach might have
significant impact on the study of very early universe and quantum cosmology.

Phenomenology of Quantum Reduced Loop Gravity in the isotropic  cosmological sector","Emanuele Alesci, Aurélien Barrau, Gioele Botta, Killian Martineau, Gabriele Stagno"," Quantum reduced loop gravity is designed to consistently study symmetry
reduced systems within the loop quantum gravity framework. In particular, it
bridges the gap between the effective cosmological models of loop quantum
cosmology and the full theory, addressing the dynamics before the

quantum numbers. In this article, we study the phenomenological consequences of
the isotropic sector of the theory, the so-called emergent bouncing universe

number of inflationary e-folds is almost always higher than the observational
lower-bound. We also compute the primordial tensor power spectrum and study its

Particle creation in the framework of f(G) gravity","R. Rashidi, F. Ahmadi, M.R. Setare"," In this paper, we study the problem of massless particle creation in a flat,
homogeneous and isotropic universe in the framework of $f(G)$ gravity. The
Bogolyubov coefficients are calculated for the accelerating power-law solutions
of the model in a matter dominated universe, from which the total number of
created particle per unit volume of space can be obtained. It is proved that
the total particle density always has a finite value. Therefore, the Bogolyubov
transformations are well-defined and the Hilbert spaces spanned by the vacuum
states at different times are unitarily equivalent. We find that the particles
with small values of the mode $k$ are produced in the past and particles with
large values of $k$ are produced only in the future. The negative pressure
resulting from the gravitational particle creation is also determined. It is
then argued that this pressure even in the presence of energy density and
thermal pressure may affect significantly the cosmic expansion.

Representations of chiral alternative to vierbein and construction of  non-Abelian instanton solution in curved space-time",K. Maharana," A chiral alternative to the vierbein field in general relativity was
considered by 't Hooft in an attempt to facilitate the construction of a
quantum theory of gravity. These objects $ f^a{}_{\mu\nu}$ behave like the
""cube root"" of the metric tensor. We try to construct specific representations
of these tensors in terms of Dirac $\gamma $ matrices in Euclidean and
Minkowski space, and promote these to curved space through Newman-Penrose
formalism. We conjecture that these are new objects with physical significance
and are the analog of Killing-Yano tensors. As an application, we try to
construct non-Abelian instanton like solutions in curved space from the flat
space 't Hooft tensors. The space part of the tensors are decomposed to a
product of Levi-Civita tensor and flat space Dirac gamma matrices. The gamma
matrices are promoted to the curved space with the help of vierbeins, as in
separability of Dirac equation by Chandrasekhar, using Newman-Penrose
formalism. The curved space generalisation of the instanton solution $A_{\mu}^a
$ is now constructed by substituting all objects to their general covariant
form.

Measuring our velocity from fluctuations in number counts","Nidhi Pant, Aditya Rotti, Carlos A.P. Bengaly, Roy Maartens"," Our velocity relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) generates a
dipole from the CMB monopole, which was accurately measured by COBE. The
relative velocity also modulates and aberrates the CMB fluctuations, generating
a small signature of statistical isotropy violation in the covariance matrix.
This signature was first measured by Planck 2013. Galaxy surveys are similarly
affected by a Doppler boost. The dipole generated from the number count
monopole has been extensively discussed, and measured (at very low accuracy) in
the NVSS and TGSS radio continuum surveys. For the first time, we present an
analysis of the Doppler imprint on the number count fluctuations, using the
bipolar spherical harmonic formalism to quantify these effects. Next-generation
wide-area surveys with a high redshift range are needed to detect the small
Doppler signature in number count fluctuations. We show that radio continuum
surveys with the SKA should enable a detection at $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ in Phase
2, with marginal detection possible in Phase 1.

Double-soft graviton amplitudes and the extended BMS charge algebra","Jacques Distler, Raphael Flauger, Bart Horn"," We discuss how scattering amplitudes in 4d Minkowski spacetime which involve
multiple soft gravitons realize the algebra of BMS charges on the null
boundary. In particular, we show how the commutator of two such charges is
realized by the antisymmetrized consecutive soft limit of the double soft
amplitude. The commutator is found to be robust even in the presence of quantum
corrections, and the associated Lie algebra has an extension, which breaks the
BMS symmetry if the BMS algebra is taken to include the Virasoro algebra of
local superrotations. We discuss the implications of this structure for the
existence of a 2d CFT dual description for 4d scattering amplitudes.

The weak null condition and global existence using the p-weighted energy  method",Joseph Keir," We prove global existence for solutions arising from small initial data for a
large class of quasilinear wave equations satisfying the `weak null condition'
of Lindblad and Rodnianski, significantly enlarging upon the class of equations
for which global existence is known. In addition to the usual weak null
condition, we require a certain hierarchical structure in the semilinear terms.
Included in this class are the Einstein equations in harmonic coordinates, so a
special case of our results is a new proof of the stability of Minkowski space.
Our proof also applies to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell system in harmonic
coordinates and Lorenz gauge, as well as to various model scalar wave equations
which do not satisfy the null condition. Our proof also applies to the
Einstein(-Maxwell) equations if, after writing the equations as a set of
nonlinear wave equations, we then `forget' about the gauge conditions. The
methods we use allow us to treat initial data which only has a small
`degenerate energy', involving a weight that degenerates at null infinity, so
the usual (unweighted) energy might be unbounded. We also demonstrate a
connection between the weak null condition and geometric shock formation,
showing that equations satisfying the weak null condition can exhibit `shock
formation at infinity', of which we provide an explicit example. The methods
that we use are very robust, including a generalisation of the p-weighted
energy method of Dafermos and Rodnianski, adapted to the dynamic geometry. This
means that our proof applies in a wide range of situations, include those in
which the metric remains close to, but never approaches the flat metric in some
spatially bounded domain, and those in which the `geometric' null infinity and
the `background' null infinity differ dramatically, for example, when the
solution exhibits shock formation at null infinity.

Chaos and entanglement spreading in a non-commutative gauge theory","Willy Fischler, Viktor Jahnke, Juan F. Pedraza"," Holographic theories with classical gravity duals are maximally chaotic: they
saturate a set of bounds on the spread of quantum information. In this paper we
question whether non-locality can affect such bounds. Specifically, we consider
the gravity dual of a prototypical theory with non-local interactions, namely,
$\mathcal{N}=4$ non-commutative super Yang Mills. We construct shock waves
geometries that correspond to perturbations of the thermofield double state
with definite momentum and study several chaos related properties of the
theory, including the butterfly velocity, the entanglement velocity, the
scrambling time and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The latter two are
unaffected by the non-commutative parameter $\theta$, however, both the
butterfly and entanglement velocities increase with the strength of the
non-commutativity. This implies that non-local interactions can enhance the
effective light-cone for the transfer of quantum information, eluding
previously conjectured bounds encountered in the context of local quantum field
theory. We comment on a possible limitation on the retrieval of quantum
information imposed by non-locality.

Forecasting Gamma-Ray Bursts using Gravitational Waves",Sarp Akcay," We explore the intriguing possibility of employing future ground-based
gravitational-wave interferometers to detect the inspiral of binary neutron
stars sufficiently early to alert electromagnetic observatories so that a
gamma-ray burst (GRB) can be observed in its entirety from its very beginning.
We quantify the ability to predict a GRB by computing the time a binary neutron
star (BNS) system takes to inspiral from its moment of detection to its final
merger. We define the moment of detection to be the instant at which the
interferometer network accumulates a signal-to-noise ratio of 15. For our
computations, we specifically consider BNS systems at luminosity distances of
(i) $D\le200\,$Mpc for the three-interferometer Advanced-LIGO-Virgo network of
2020, and (ii) $D\le 1000\,$Mpc for Einstein Telescope's B and C
configurations. In the case of Advanced LIGO-Virgo we find that we may at best
get a few minutes of warning time, thus we expect no forecast of GRBs in the
2020s. On the other hand, Einstein Telescope will provide us with advance
warning times of more than five hours for $D\le 100$Mpc. Taking one hour as a
benchmark advance warning time, we obtain a corresponding range of roughly 600
Mpc for the Einstein Telescope C configuration. Using current BNS merger event
rates within this volume, we show that Einstein C will forecast
$\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ GRBs in the 2030s. We reapply our warning-time
computation to binary black hole - neutron star inspirals and find 1 to 3 tidal
disruption events to be forecast by the same detector. This is a pedagogical
introduction to gravitational-wave astronomy written at a level accessible to
PhD students, advanced undergraduates, and colleagues in astronomy/astrophysics
who wish to learn more about the underlying physics. Though many of our results
may be known to the experts, they might nonetheless find this article
motivating and exciting.

Thermodynamics of charged accelerating AdS black holes and holographic  heat engines","Jialin Zhang, Yanjun Li, Hongwei Yu"," We explicitly formulate the consistent first law of thermodynamics for a
charged accelerating Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole with a reasonable
normalization of the timelike vector. The expression of renormalized
thermodynamic mass is exactly derived, which displays an intertwining behavior
with the charge in a complex way due to the special asymptotic structure of the
gauge field. The thermodynamic length as a potential conjugate to the varying
cosmic string tension is also introduced and analyzed in detail. Furthermore,
we investigate the properties of holographic heat engines with charged
accelerating AdS black holes as the working substance in a benchmarking scheme.
We find that the efficiencies of the black hole heat engines can be influenced
by both the size of the benchmark circular cycle and the cosmic string tension.
More interestingly, the existence of charge may significantly increase the
efficiencies of the black hole heat engines and make them be more sensitive to
a varying cosmic string tension. A cross-comparison of the efficiencies of
different black hole heat engines suggests that the acceleration also increases
the efficiency and renders it more sensitive as the charge varies.

Gravitational smoothing of kinks on cosmic string loops","Jeremy M. Wachter, Ken D. Olum"," We analyze the effect of gravitational back reaction on cosmic string loops
with kinks, which is an important determinant of the shape, and thus the
potential observability, of string loops which may exist in the universe today.
Kinks are not rounded off, but may be straightened out. This means that back
reaction will only cause loops with kinks to develop cusps after some
potentially large fraction of their lifetimes. In some loops, symmetries
prevent even this process, so that the loop evaporates in a self-similar
fashion and the kinks are unchanged. As an example, we discuss back-reaction on

Gauge protected entanglement between gravity and matter","Nikola Paunkovic, Marko Vojinovic"," We show that gravity and matter fields are generically entangled, as a
consequence of the local Poincar\'e symmetry. First, we present a general
argument, applicable to any particular theory of quantum gravity with matter,
by performing the analysis in the abstract nonperturbative canonical framework,
demonstrating the nonseparability of the scalar constraint, thus promoting the
entangled states as the physical ones. Also, within the covariant framework, we
show explicitly that the Hartle-Hawking state in the Regge model of quantum
gravity is necessarily entangled. Our result is potentially relevant for the
quantum-to-classical transition, taken within the framework of the decoherence
programme: due to the gauge symmetry requirements, the matter does not
decohere, it is by default decohered by gravity. Generically, entanglement is a
consequence of interaction. This new entanglement could potentially, in form of
an ""effective interaction"", bring about corrections to the weak equivalence
principle, further confirming that spacetime as a smooth four-dimensional
manifold is an emergent phenomenon. Finally, the existence of the
gauge-protected entanglement between gravity and matter could be seen as a
criterion for a plausible theory of quantum gravity, and in the case of
perturbative quantisation approaches, a confirmation of the persistence of the
manifestly broken gauge symmetry.

Distinguishing black holes and naked singularities with iron line  spectroscopy","Honghui Liu, Menglei Zhou, Cosimo Bambi"," It is commonly thought that the final product of gravitational collapse is a
black hole. Nevertheless, theoretical studies have not yet provided a final
answer to the question whether black holes are the only possible outcome or
whether naked singularities are also allowed. Observational tests may thus
represent a complementary approach. In the present paper, we consider the
Janis-Newman-Winicour metric, which describes a rotating source with a
surface-like naked singularity. We calculate iron line shapes in the reflection
spectrum of a putative disk around a Janis-Newman-Winicour singularity and we
compare our results with the iron line shapes expected in the spectrum of a
Kerr black hole. While it is difficult to distinguish the two spacetimes from
the iron line shape in general, it seems that Janis-Newman-Winicour
singularities cannot mimic fast-rotating Kerr black holes observed at a low or
moderate inclination angle. Our analysis thus suggests that available
observations of specific sources can already constrain the possible existence
of Janis-Newman-Winicour singularities in the Universe.

Tale of stable interacting dark energy, observational signatures, and  the $H_0$ tension","Weiqiang Yang, Supriya Pan, Eleonora Di Valentino, Rafael C. Nunes, Sunny Vagnozzi, David F. Mota"," We investigate the observational consequences of a novel class of stable
interacting dark energy (IDE) models, featuring interactions between dark
matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). In the first part of our work, we start by
considering two IDE models which are known to present early-time linear
perturbation instabilities. Applying a transformation depending on the dark
energy equation of state (EoS) to the DM-DE coupling, we then obtain two novel
stable IDE models. Subsequently, we derive robust and accurate constraints on
the parameters of these models, assuming a constant EoS $w_x$ for the DE fluid,
in light of some of the most recent publicly available cosmological data. These
include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization
anisotropy measurements from the \textit{Planck} satellite, a selection of
Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, Supernovae Type-Ia luminosity
distance measurements from the JLA sample, and measurements of the Hubble
parameter up to redshift $2$ from cosmic chronometers. Our analysis displays a
mild preference for the DE fluid residing in the phantom region ($w_x<-1$),
with significance up to 95\% confidence level, while we obtain new upper limits
on the coupling parameter between the dark components. The preference for a
phantom DE suggests a coupling function $Q<0$, thus a scenario where energy
flows from the DE to the DM. We also examine the possibility of addressing the
$H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions, finding that only the former can be partially
alleviated. Finally, we perform a Bayesian model comparison analysis to
quantify the possible preference for the two IDE models against the standard
concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, finding that the latter is always preferred

Space and time as a consequence of GRW quantum jumps",Tejinder P. Singh," The Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory of spontaneous collapse offers a

wave function of a particle spontaneously and repeatedly localises to one or
the other random position in space, as a consequence of the hypothesised
quantum jumps. In between jumps the wave function undergoes the usual

take place in Hilbert space, with no reference to physical space, and physical
three-dimensional space arises as a consequence of localisation of macroscopic
objects in the universe. That is, collapse of the wave-function is responsible
for the origin of space. We then suggest that similar jumps take place for a
hypothetical time operator in Hilbert space, and classical time as we know it
emerges from localisation of this time operator for macroscopic objects. More
generally, the jumps are suggested to take place in an operator space-time in
Hilbert space, leading to an emergent classical space-time.

Gravitating magnetic monopole via the spontaneous symmetry breaking of  pure $R^2$ gravity","Ariel Edery, Yu Nakayama"," The pure $R^2$ gravity is equivalent to Einstein gravity with cosmological
constant and a massless scalar field and it further possesses the so-called
restricted Weyl symmetry which is a symmetry larger than scale symmetry. To
incorporate matter, we consider a restricted Weyl invariant action composed of
pure $R^2$ gravity, SU(2) Yang-Mills fields and a non-minimally coupled
massless Higgs field (a triplet of scalars). When the restricted Weyl symmetry
is spontaneously broken, it is equivalent to an Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs
(EYMH) action with a cosmological constant and a massive Higgs non-minimally
coupled to gravity i.e. via a term $\tilde{\xi} R |\Phi|^2$. When the
restricted Weyl symmetry is not spontaneously broken, linearization about
Minkowski space-time does not yield gravitons in the original $R^2$ gravity and
hence it does not gravitate. However, we show that in the broken gauge sector
of our theory, where the Higgs field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation
value, Minkowski space-time is a viable gravitating background solution. We

there is always a neighbourhood of extremality in which strong cosmic
censorship is violated by perturbations arising from smooth initial data.

The lensing time delay between gravitational and electromagnetic waves","Paolo Cremonese, Edvard Mörtsell"," The recent detection of gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM)
waves originating from the same source marks the start of a new multi-messenger
era in astronomy. The arrival time difference between the GW and EM signal can
be used to constrain differences in their propagation speed, and thus
gravitational theories. We study to what extent a non-zero time delay can be
explained by gravitational lensing when the line of sight to the source passes
near a massive object. For galaxy scale lenses, this delay becomes relevant for
GWs with frequencies between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-9}$ Hz, sourced by super
massive binary black-holes. In addition to GWs detectable by Pulsar Timing
Arrays (PTAs), we expect to find also a unique and recognizable EM signal. We
show that the delay between the GW and EM signal can be of the order of days to
months; within reach of future observations. The effect may become important in
future multi-messenger astronomy probing of gravitational propagation and
interactions.

Holographic cosmology and tachyon inflation",Neven Bilic," After a brief introduction to the AdS/CFT holography a tachyon inflation will
be discussed in the framework of holographic cosmology. The model is based on a
holographic braneworld scenario with an effective tachyon field on a D3-brane
located at the holographic bound of an asymptotic ADS$_5$ bulk.

SYK/AdS duality with Yang-Baxter deformations","Arindam Lala, Dibakar Roychowdhury"," In this paper, based on the notion of SYK/AdS duality we explore the effects
of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformations on the SYK spectrum at strong coupling. In the
first part of our analysis, we explore the consequences of YB deformations
through the Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction on $ (AdS_2)_{\eta}\times (S^1)/Z_2 $.
It turns out that the YB effects (on the SYK spectrum) starts showing off at
\textit{quadratic} order in $ 1/J $ expansion. For the rest of the analysis, we
provide an interpretation for the YB deformations in terms of
bi-local/collective field excitations of the SYK model. Using large $ N $
techniques, we evaluate the effective action upto quadratic order in the
fluctuations and estimate $ 1/J^2 $ corrections to the correlation function at
strong coupling.
